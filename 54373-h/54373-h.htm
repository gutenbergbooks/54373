</div>
<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c010'>Questions of such absorbing interest to the human race
as “The State of the Dead,” and “The Destiny of the
Wicked,” should command the candid attention of all
serious and thoughtful men. The Bible alone can answer
the inquiries of the human mind on these important subjects;
and if the Bible is the full and complete revelation
which it claims to be, we must believe that it has answered
them. What that answer is, the following pages
undertake to show.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the questions here discussed there is at the present
time a daily-increasing agitation in the theological world.
The frequency with which these topics come to the surface
in the religious papers of the land, is evidence of this.
Not only in this country, but in England and Germany,
the views of Bible students on these points are in a state
of transition. The doctrine that there is no eternal life
out of Christ, and that consequently the punishment of
the wicked is not to be eternal misery, is now able to present
an array of adherents so strong in numbers, so cultivated
in intellect, and so correct at heart, that many of
its opponents are changing their base of operations toward
it, and taking steps looking not only to a toleration of its
existence, but to a compromise with its claims.</p>

<p class='c011'>In adding another book to the many which have been
written on this subject, the object has been to give in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>concise manner a more general view of the teaching of
the word of God, the ultimate source of authority, on this
question, than has heretofore been presented. A chapter
on the Claims of Philosophy is appended to the Biblical
argument, more to answer the queries of those who attach
importance to such considerations, than because they
are entitled to any real weight in the determination of
this controversy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The interest that has of late years arisen on the subject
of the state of the dead, is timely. Spiritualism, with its
foul embrace and pestilential breath, is seeking to spread
its pollutions over all the land; and it appeals to the popular
views of the condition of man in death as a foundation
for its claims. The teaching of the Bible on this
point is the most effectual antidote to that unhallowed
delusion. Before the true light on the intermediate state,
and the destiny of the wicked, not only spiritualism with
its foul brood flees away, but purgatory, saint worship,
universalism, and a host of other errors all go down.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this period of agitation and transition, let no man
blindly commit himself to predetermined views, but hold
himself ready to follow truth always and everywhere.
Let him hold his sympathies entirely at its disposal. This
is the course of safety; for truth has angels, Christ and
God upon its side; and though it had but one adherent
on the earth, it would triumph all the same. So while
truth can receive no detriment from the combined opposition
of all the world, its adherents, few in number though
they may be, will secure in the end an everlasting gain.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER I. <br /> <span class='fss'>PRIMARY QUESTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Gradually the mind awakes to the mystery
of life. Excepting only the first pair, every adult
member of the human race has come up through
the helplessness of infancy and the limited acquirements
of childhood. All have reached
their full capacity to think and do, only by the
slow development of their mental and physical
powers. Without either counsel or co-operation
of our own, we find ourselves on the plane of
human existence, subject to all the conditions of
the race, and hastening forward to its destiny,
whatever it may be.</p>

<p class='c011'>A retinue of mysterious inquiries throng our
steps. Whence came this order of things? Who
ordained this arrangement? For what purpose
are we here? What is our nature? What are
our obligations? And whither are we bound?
Life, what a mystery! Having commenced, will
it ever end? Once we did not exist; are we
destined to that condition again? Death we see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>everywhere around us. Its victims are silent,
cold, and still. They give no outward evidence
of retaining any of those faculties, mental, emotional,
or physical, which distinguished them
when living. Is death the end of all these?
And is death the extinction of the race? These
are questions which have ever excited in the
human mind an intensity of thought, and a
strength of feeling, which no other subjects can
produce.</p>

<p class='c011'>To these questions, so well-defined, so definite
in their demands, and of such all-absorbing interest,
where shall we look for an answer? Have
we any means within our reach by which to solve
these problems? We look abroad upon the earth
and admire its multiplied forms of life and beauty;
we mark the revolving seasons and the uniform
and beneficent operations of nature; we look to
the heavenly bodies and behold their glory, and
the regularity of their mighty motions--do these
answer our questions? They tell us something,
but not all. They tell us of the great Creator
and upholder of all things; for, as the apostle
says, “The invisible things of him from the creation
of the world are clearly seen, being understood
by the things that are made, even his eternal
power and Godhead.” They tell us upon
whom our existence depends and to whom we are
amenable.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this only intensifies our anxiety a thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>fold. For now we want to know upon
what conditions his favor is suspended. What
must we do to meet his requirements? How
may we secure his approbation? He surely is a
being who will reward virtue and punish sin.
Sometime our deeds must be compared with his
requirements, and sentence be rendered in accordance
therewith. How will this affect our future
existence? Deriving it from him, does he suspend
its continuance on our obedience? or has
he made us self-existent beings, so that we must
live forever, if not in his favor, then the conscious
recipients of his wrath?</p>

<p class='c011'>With what intense anxiety the mind turns to
the future. What is to be the issue of this mysterious
problem of life? Who can tell? Nature
is silent. We appeal to those who are entering
the dark valley. But who can reveal the mysteries
of those hidden regions till he has explored
them? and the “curtain of the tent into which
they enter, never outward swings.” Sternly
the grave closes its heavy portals against every
attempt to catch a glimpse of the unknown
beyond. Science proves itself a fool on this
momentous question. The imagination breaks
down; and the human mind, unaided, sinks into
a melancholy, but well-grounded, despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>God must tell us, or we can never know what
lies beyond this state of existence, till we experience
it for ourselves. He who has placed us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>here, must himself make known to us his purposes
and his will, or we are forever in the dark.
Of this, all reverent and thoughtful minds are
well assured.</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Stuart, in his “Exegetical Essays
on Several Words Relating to Future Punishment,”
says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The light of nature can never scatter the darkness in
question. This light has never yet sufficed to make the
question clear to any portion of our benighted race,
whether the soul is immortal. Cicero, incomparably the
most able defender of the soul’s immortality of which the
heathen world can yet boast, very ingenuously confesses
that, after all the arguments which he had adduced in
order to confirm the doctrine in question, it so fell out
that his mind was satisfied of it only when directly employed
in contemplating the arguments adduced in its
favor. At all other times he fell unconsciously into a
state of doubt and darkness. It is notorious, also, that
Socrates, the next most able advocate, among the heathen,
of the same doctrine, has adduced arguments to
establish the never-ceasing existence of the soul which
will not bear the test of examination. If there be any
satisfactory light, then, on the momentous question of a
future state, it must be sought from the word of God.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>H. H. Dobney, Baptist minister, of England
(Future Punishment, p. 107), says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Reason cannot prove man to be immortal. We may
devoutly enter the temple of nature, we may reverently
tread her emerald floor, and gaze on her blue, ‘star-pictured
ceiling,’ but to our anxious inquiry, though
proposed with heart-breaking intensity, the oracle is
dumb, or like those of Delphi and Dodona, mutters only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>an ambitious reply that leaves us in utter bewilderment.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>And what information have they been able to
give us, who have either been ignorant of divine
revelation, or, having the light, have turned their
backs upon it? Listen to a little of what they
have told us, which sufficiently indicates the
character of the knowledge they possessed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Socrates, when about to drink the fatal hemlock,
said:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“I am going out of the world, and you are to continue
in it; but which of us has the better part, is a secret to
every one but God.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Cicero, after recounting the various opinions of
philosophers on this subject, levels all their systems
to the ground by this ingenuous confession:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Which of these is true, God alone knows, and which
is the most probable, is a very great question.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Seneca, reviewing the arguments of the ancients
on this subject, said:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Immortality, however desirable, was rather promised
than proved by these great men.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>And the skeptic Hobbs, when death was forcing
him from this state of existence, could only
exclaim, with dread uncertainty, “I am taking a
leap in the dark!”--dying words not calculated
to inspire any great degree of comfort and assurance
in the hearts of those who are inclined to
follow in his steps.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>With a full sense of our need, we turn, then,
to the revelation which God has given us in his
word. Will this answer our inquiries? It is not
a revelation if it does not; for this must be the
very object of a revelation. Logicians tell us
that there is “an antecedent probability in favor
of a divine revelation, arising from the nature of
the Deity and the moral condition of man.” On
the same ground, there must be an equal probability
that, if we are immortal, never-dying beings,
that revelation will plainly tell us so.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the Bible alone, we look for correct views
on the important subjects of the character of
God, the nature of life and death, the resurrection,
Heaven, and hell. But our views upon all
these, must be, to a great extent, governed by
our views of the nature and destiny of man. On
this subject, therefore, the teachings of the Bible
must, of consistency, be sufficiently clear and full.</p>

<p class='c011'>Prominent upon the pages of inspiration, we
see pointed out the great distinction which God
has put between right and wrong, the rewards
he has promised to virtue, and the punishment
he has threatened against sin; we find it revealed
that but few, comparatively, will be saved, while
the great majority of our race will be lost; and
as the means by which the perdition of ungodly
men is accomplished, we find described in fearfully
ominous terms, a lake of fire burning with
brimstone, intense and unquenchable.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>How these facts intensify the importance of
the question, Are all men immortal? Are these
wicked immortal? Is their portion an eternity
of incomprehensible, conscious torture, and unutterable
woe? Have they in their nature a principle
so tenacious of life that the severest implements
of destruction with which the Almighty
can assail it, an eternity of his intensest devouring
fire can make no inroads upon its inviolate
vitality? Fearful questions!--questions in reference
to which it cannot be that the word of
God will leave us in darkness, or perplex us with
doubt, or deceive us with falsehood.</p>

<p class='c011'>In commending the reader to the word of
God on this great theme, it is unnecessary to suggest
to any candid mind the spirit in which we
should present our inquiries. Prejudice or passion
should not come within the sacred precincts
of such an investigation. If God has plainly revealed
that all the finally impenitent of our race
are doomed to an eternity of conscious misery,
we must accept that fact, however hard it may
be to find any correspondence between the magnitude
of the guilt and the infinitude of the punishment,
and however hard it may be to reconcile
such treatment with the character of a God who
has declared himself to be “<span class='sc'>Love</span>.” If, on the
other hand, the record shows that God’s government
can be vindicated, sin meet its just deserts,
and at the same time such disposition be finally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>made of the lost, as to relieve the universe from
the horrid spectacle of a hell forever burning,
filled with sensitive beings, frenzied with fire and
flame, and blaspheming in their ever-strengthening
agony--can any one be the less ready to
accept this fact, or hesitate, on this account, to
join in the ascription, “Great and marvelous are
thy works, Lord God Almighty; <em>just and true</em>
are thy ways, thou King of saints”?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER II. <br /> <span class='fss'>IMMORTAL AND IMMORTALITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In turning to the Bible, our only source of information
on this question, to learn whether or
not man is immortal, the first and most natural
step in the inquiry is to ascertain what use the
Bible makes of the terms “immortal” and “immortality.”
How frequently does it use them?
To whom does it apply them? Of whom does it
make immortality an attribute? Does it affirm
it of man or any part of him?</p>

<p class='c011'>Should we, without opening the Bible, endeavor
to form an opinion of its teachings from
the current phraseology of modern theology, we
should conclude it to be full of declarations in
the most explicit terms that man is in possession
of an immortal soul and deathless spirit; for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>popular religious literature of to-day, which
claims to be a true reflection of the declarations
of God’s word, is full of these expressions.
Glibly they fall from the lips of the religious
teacher. Broadcast they go forth from the religious
press. Into orthodox sermons and prayers
they enter as essential elements. They are
appealed to as the all-prolific source of comfort
and consolation in case of those who mourn the
loss of friends by death. We are told that they
are not dead; for “there is no death; what seems
so is transition;” they have only changed to another
state of being, only gone before; for the soul
is immortal, the spirit never dying; and it cannot
for a moment cease its conscious existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is all right provided the Bible warrants
such declarations. But it is far from safe to conclude
without examination that the Bible does
warrant them; for whoever has read church history
knows that it is little more than a record of
the unceasing attempts of the great enemy of all
truth to corrupt the practices of the professors of
Christianity, and to pervert and obscure the simple
teachings of God’s word with the absurdities
and mysticisms of heathen mythology. It has
been only by the utmost vigilance that any
Christian institution has been preserved, or any
Christian doctrine saved, free from some of the
corruptions of the great systems of false religion
which have always held by far the greater portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of our race in their chains of darkness and
superstition. And if we arraign the creeds of
the six hundred Protestant sects, as containing
many unscriptural dogmas, it is only what every
one of them does, in reference to the other five
hundred and ninety-nine.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the law, then, and to the testimony. What
say the Scriptures on the subject of immortality?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Fact</span> 1. The terms “immortal” and “immortality”
are not found in the Old Testament, either
in our English version or in the original Hebrew.
There is, however, one expression, in Gen. 3:4,
which is, perhaps, equivalent in meaning, and
was spoken in reference to the human race;
namely, “Thou shalt not surely die.” But unfortunately
for believers in natural immortality,
this declaration came from one whom no person
would like to acknowledge as the author of his
creed. It is what the devil said to Eve, the terrible
deception by means of which he accomplished
her fall, and so “brought death into the
world and all our woe.” But does not the New
Testament supply this seemingly unpardonable
omission of the Old, by many times affirming
that all men have immortality?</p>

<p class='c011'>Remembering the many times you have heard
and read from Biblical expositors that you were
in possession of an immortal soul, how many times
do you think that declaration is made in the New
Testament? One hundred times? Fifty? Thirty?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Twenty? Ten? No. Five? No. Twice? <em>No.</em>
<span class='sc'>Once?</span> NO! Does not the New Testament
then apply the term immortal to anything? Yes;
and this brings us to</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Fact</span> 2. The term immortal is used but once
in the New Testament, in the English version,
and is then applied to God. The following is the
passage: 1 Tim. 1:17: “Now unto the King
eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be
honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The original word, however, αφθαρτος (<em>aphthartos</em>)
from which immortal is here translated, occurs
in six other instances in the New Testament,
in every one of which it is rendered incorruptible.
The word is defined by Greenfield, “Incorruptible,
immortal, imperishable, undying, enduring.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is used, first, to describe God, in Rom. 1:23,
“And changed the glory of the <em>uncorruptible</em>
God into an image made like to corruptible man,
and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping
things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is used in 1 Cor. 9:25, to describe the
heavenly crown of the overcomer: “And every
man that striveth for the mastery is temperate
in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible
crown, but we an <em>incorruptible</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is used in 1 Cor. 15:52, to describe the immortal
bodies of the redeemed: “In a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump;
for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>be raised <em>incorruptible</em>, and we shall be changed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is used in 1 Tim. 1:17, to describe God as
already quoted.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is used in 1 Pet. 1:4, to describe the inheritance
reserved in Heaven for the overcomer:
“To an inheritance <em>incorruptible</em> and undefiled,
that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is used in 1 Pet. 1:23, to describe the principle
by which regeneration is wrought in us:
“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
<em>incorruptible</em>, by the word of God, which liveth
and abideth forever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is used in 1 Pet. 3:4, to describe the heavenly
adorning which we are to labor to secure:
“But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in
that which is <em>not corruptible</em>, even the ornament
of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight
of God of great price.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And these are all the instances of its use. In
no one of them is it applied to man or any part
of him, as a natural possession. But does not
the last text affirm that man is in possession of a
deathless spirit? The words “incorruptible” and
“spirit” both occur, it is true, in the same verse;
but they do not stand together, another noun and
its adjectives coming in between them; they are
not in the same case, incorruptible being in the
dative, and spirit, in the genitive; they are not
of the same gender, incorruptible being masculine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>or feminine, and spirit, neuter. What is it
which is in the sight of God of great price? The
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit. What is
the nature of this ornament? It is not destructible
like the laurel wreath, the rich apparel, the
gold and gems with which the unsanctified man
seeks to adorn himself; but it is incorruptible, a
disposition molded by the Spirit of God, some
of the fruit of that heavenly tree which God values.
Does man by nature possess this incorruptible
ornament, this meek and quiet spirit? No; for
we are exhorted to procure and adopt this instead
of the other. This, and this only, the text affirms.
To say that this text proves that man is in possession
of a deathless spirit, is no more consistent
nor logical than it would be to say that Paul declares
that man has an immortal soul, because in
his first epistle to Timothy (1:17), he uses the
word immortal, and in his first epistle to the
Thessalonians (5:23), he uses the word soul. The
argument would be the same in both cases.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Fact</span> 3. The word “immortality” occurs but
five times in the New Testament, in our English
version. The following are the instances:--</p>

<p class='c011'>In Rom. 2:7, it is set forth as something for
which we are to seek by patient continuance in
well-doing: “To them who by patient continuance
in well-doing seek for glory and honor and
<em>immortality</em>, [God will render] eternal life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1 Cor. 15:53, 54, it is twice used to describe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>what this mortal must put on before we can inherit
the kingdom of God: “For this corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
put on <em>immortality</em>. So when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal
shall have put on <em>immortality</em>, then shall be
brought to pass the saying that is written, Death
is swallowed up in victory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1 Tim. 6:16, it is applied to God, and the
sweeping declaration is made that he alone has
it: “Who only hath <em>immortality</em>, dwelling in
the light which no man can approach unto;
whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom
be honor and power everlasting. Amen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In 2 Tim. 1:10, we are told from what source
we receive the true light concerning it, which
forever cuts off the claim that reason or science
can demonstrate it, or that the oracles of heathenism
can make it known to us: “But now is
made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and
hath brought life and <em>immortality</em> to light
through the gospel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How has Christ brought life and immortality
to light? Answer: By abolishing death. There
could have been no life nor immortality without
this; for the race were hopelessly doomed to
death through sin. Then by what means and
for whom has he abolished death? Answer:
By dying for man and rising again, a victor over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>death; and he has wrought this work only for
those who will accept of it through him; for all
who reject his proffered aid will meet at last the
same fate that would have been the lot of all,
had Christ never undertaken in our behalf. Thus
through the gospel, the good news of salvation
through him, he has brought to light the fact,
not that all men are by nature already in possession
of immortality, but that a way is opened
whereby we may at last gain possession of this
inestimable boon.</p>

<p class='c011'>As with the word immortal, so with immortality:
the original from which it comes, occurs
a few more times than it is so translated in the
English version. There are two words translated
immortality. These are ἀθανασία (<em>athanasia</em>)
and ἀφθαρσία (<em>aphtharsia</em>). The former is
defined by Greenfield and Robinson simply “immortality,”
and is so translated in every instance.
It occurs three times, in 1 Cor. 15:53,
54; 1 Tim. 6:16, as noticed above. The latter
is defined, by the same authorities, “incorruptibility,
incorruptness; by implication, immortality.”
In addition to the instances above cited,
it occurs in the following passages; in all eight
times:--</p>

<p class='c011'>1 Cor. 15:42: “So also is the resurrection of
the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised
in <em>incorruption</em>.” In verses 50, 53 and 54, of
the same chapter, it is that <em>incorruption</em> which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>corruption [our present mortal condition] does
not inherit, and which this corruptible must put
on before we can enter into the kingdom of God.
In Eph. 6:24, it is used to describe the love we
should bear to Christ, and in Titus 2:7, the
quality of the doctrine we should hold, in both
which instances it is translated “sincerity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We now have before us all the testimony of
the Bible relative to immortality. So far from
being applied to man, the term is used as in
Rom. 1:23, to point out the contrast between
God and man. God is incorruptible or immortal.
Man is corruptible or mortal. But if the
real man, the essential being, consists of an undecaying
soul, a deathless spirit, he, too, is incorruptible,
and this contrast could not be drawn.
It is placed before us as an object of hope for
which we are to seek: declarations which would
be a fraud and deception if we already have it.
It is used to distinguish between heavenly and
eternal objects, and those that are earthly and
decaying. In view of these facts, no candid
mind can dissent from the following</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Conclusion</span>: So far as its use of the terms
“immortal” and “immortality” is concerned,
the Bible contains no proof that man is in possession
of an undying nature.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER III. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE IMAGE OF GOD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>If man is immortal, we should naturally suppose
that the Bible would make known so weighty
a truth in some of the instances where it has had
occasion to use the words immortal and immortality.
Where else could it more properly be
revealed? And the fact that its use of those
terms affords no proof that man is in possession
of this great attribute, but rather that it belongs
to God alone, should cause a person to receive
with great allowance the positive assertions of
popular theology on this question. Nevertheless
it is supposed that there are other sources from
which proof can be drawn that man has a hold
on life equal with that of Jehovah himself; so
that he will live as long as God exists.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first of these is the opening testimony of
the Bible concerning man, which asserts that he
was to be made in the image of God. Gen. 1:26,
27: “And God said, Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the
earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth. So God created man in his
own image, in the image of God created he him;
male and female created he them.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The first impulse of a person unacquainted
with this controversy would be to ask in astonishment
what this has to do with the immortality
of man; nor would his astonishment be in any
wise diminished when he heard the reply that
as God is immortal, man, made in his image,
must be immortal also. Has God, then, no other
attribute but immortality, that we must confine
it to this? Is not God omnipotent? Yes.
Is man? No. Is not God omnipresent? Yes.
Is man? No. Is not God omniscient? Yes.
Is man? No. Is not God independent and self-existent?
Yes. Is man? No. Is not God infallible?
Yes. Is man? No. Then why single
out the one attribute of immortality, and
make the likeness of man to God consist wholly
in this? In the form of a syllogism the popular
argument stands thus:--</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Major Premise</em>: God is immortal. 1 Tim.
1:17.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Minor Premise</em>: Man is created in the image
of God. Gen. 1:27.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Conclusion</em>: Therefore man is immortal.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is easily quashed by another equally good,
thus:--</p>

<p class='c011'>1. God is omnipotent.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Man is made in the image of God.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. Therefore man is omnipotent.</p>

<p class='c011'>This conclusion, by being brought within the
cognizance of our senses, becomes more obviously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>though it is not more essentially, absurd. It
shows either that the argument for immortality
drawn from the image of God, is unqualified assumption,
or that puny and finite man is clothed
with all the attributes of the deity.</p>

<p class='c011'>In what respect, then, is man in the image of
his Maker? A universal rule of interpretation,
applying to Bible language as well as any other,
is to allow every word its most obvious and
literal import, unless some plain reason exists
for giving it a mystical or figurative meaning.
The plain and literal definition of image is, as
given by Webster, “An imitation, representation
or similitude of any person or thing, sculptured,
drawn, painted, or otherwise made <em>perceptible to
the sight</em>; a <em>visible</em> presentation; a copy; a likeness;
an effigy.” We have italicized a portion
of this definition as containing an essential idea.
An image must be something that is visible
to the eye. How can we conceive of an image
of anything that is not perceptible to the sight,
and which we cannot take cognizance of by any
of the senses? Even an image formed in the
mind must be conceived of as having some sort
of outward shape or form. In this sense, of having
outward form, the word is used in each of
the thirty-one times of its occurrence elsewhere
in the Old Testament.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second time the word image is used, it is
used to show the relation existing between son
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and father, and is a good comment on the relation
which Gen. 1:26, 27, asserts to exist between
man and God. Gen. 5:3: “And Adam
lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a
son in his own likeness, after his image.” No
one would think of referring this to anything
but physical resemblance. Now put the two
passages together. Moses first asserts that God
made man in his own image, after his likeness,
and a few chapters farther on asserts that this
same man begat a son in his own likeness, after
his image. And, while all must admit that this
latter refers to bodily form or physical shape, the
theological schools tell us that the former, from
the same writer, and with no intimation that it
is used in any other sense, must refer solely to
the attribute of immortality. Is not this taking
unwarrantable liberty with the inspired testimony?
There is no room for any other conclusion
than that just as a son is, in outward
appearance, the image of his father, so man possesses,
not the nature and attributes of God in
all their perfection, but a likeness or image of
him in his physical form.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be said that the word image is used in
a different sense in the New Testament, as, for
example, in Col. 3:9, 10: “Lie not one to another,
seeing that ye have put off the old man
with his deeds, and have put on the new man,
which is renewed in knowledge after the image
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of him that created him.” Let it ever be borne
in mind that the point which popular theology
has to prove is that man is immortal because in
the image of God. This text is against that
view; for that which is here said to be in the
image of Him that created him, is not the natural
man himself, but the new man which is put
on, implying that the image had been destroyed,
and could be restored only in Christ. If, therefore,
it meant immortality as used by Moses, this
text would show that that immortality was not
absolute, but contingent, and, having been lost
by the race, can be regained only through Christ.</p>

<p class='c011'>Eph. 4:24, shows how this new man is created:
“And that ye put on the new man, which
after God is created in righteousness and true
holiness.” Nothing is said about immortality
even in connection with the new man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again: The word here translated image (ἐικων)
is defined by Greenfield, as meaning by metonymy,
“an exemplar, model, pattern, standard,
Col. 3:10.” No such definition as this is given
by Gesenius to the word in Genesis. So, though
this Greek word may here have this sense, it
affords no evidence that the Hebrew word in
Gen. 1:26, 27, can refer to anything else but the
outward form.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same reasoning will apply to 1 Cor. 15:49,
where the “image of the heavenly,” which
is promised to the righteous, is something which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>is not in possession of the natural man, but will
be attained through the resurrection: “we <em>shall</em>
bear the image of the heavenly.” It cannot
therefore refer to the image stamped upon man
at his creation, unless it be admitted that that
image, with all its included privileges, has been
lost by the human race--an admission fatal to
the hypothesis of the believers in the natural
immortality of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1 Cor. 11:7, we read that man, as contrasted
with the woman, is “the image and
glory of God.” To make the expression “image
of God” here mean immortality, is to confine it
to man, and rob the better part of the human
race of this high prerogative.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Gen. 9:6, we read: “Whoso sheddeth
man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed;
for in the image of God made he man.” Substituting
what the image is here claimed to mean,
we should have this very singular reading:
“Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his
blood be shed; for he made him immortal, and
his life cannot be taken.” Evidently the reference
in all such passages is, not only to “the human
face divine,” but to the whole physical
frame, which, in comparison with all other forms
of animated existence, is upright and godlike.</p>

<p class='c011'>But here the mystical interpretation of our
current theology has thrown up what is considered
an insuperable objection to this view; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>how can man be physically in the image of God,
when God is not a person, is without form, and
has neither body nor parts? In reply, we ask,
Where does the Bible say that God is a formless,
impersonal being, having neither body nor parts?
Does it not say that he is a spirit? John 4:24.
Yes; and we inquire again, Does it not say that
the angels are spirits? Heb. 1:7, 14. And are
not the angels, saying nothing of those instances
in which they have appeared to men in bodily
form, and always in human shape (Gen. 18:1-8,
16-22; 32:24; Hos. 12:4; Num. 22:31; Judges
13:6, 13; Luke 1:11, 13, 28, 29; Acts 12:7-9;
&amp;c., &amp;c.), always spoken of as beings having
bodily form? A spirit, or spiritual being, as
God is, in the highest sense, so far from not having
a bodily form, must possess it, as the instrumentality
for the manifestation of his powers.
1 Cor. 15:44.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, it is urged that God is omnipresent;
and how can this be, if he is a person? Answer:
He has a representative, his Holy Spirit, by
which he is ever present and ever felt in all
his universe. “Whither shall I go,” asks David,
“from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee
from thy presence?” Ps. 139:7. And John
saw standing before the throne of God seven
Spirits, which are declared to be “the seven
Spirits of God,” and which are <a id='corr27.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sent'>“sent</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_27.28'><ins class='correction' title='sent'>“sent</ins></a></span> forth into all
the earth.” Rev. 4:5; 5:6.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>We now invite the attention of the reader to a
little of the evidence that may be presented to
show that God is a person, and so that man,
though of course in an imperfect and finite degree,
may be an image, or likeness of him, as to
his bodily form.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. God has made visible to mortal eyes parts
of his person. Moses saw the God of Israel.
Ex. 33:21-23. An immaterial being, if such a
thing can be conceived of, without body or parts,
cannot be seen with mortal eyes. To say that
God assumed a body and shape for this occasion,
places the common view in a worse light still;
for it is virtually charging upon God a double deception:
first, giving Moses to understand that
he was a being with body and parts, and, secondly,
under the promise of showing himself,
showing him something that was <em>not</em> himself.
And he told Moses that he would put his hand
over him as he passed by, and then take it away,
that he might see his back parts, but not his face.
Has he hands? has he back parts? has he a
face? If not, why try to convey ideas by means
of language?</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy
of the elders, saw the God of Israel. Ex. 24:9-11.
“And there was under his feet as it were
a paved work of a sapphire stone.” Has he feet?
Or is the record that these persons saw them, a
fabrication? No man, to be sure, has seen his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>face, nor could he do it and live, as God has declared.
Ex. 33:20; John 1:18.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Christ, as manifested among men, is declared
to be the image of God, and in his form. Christ
showed, after his resurrection, that his immortal,
though not then glorified, body, had flesh and
bones. Luke 24:29. Bodily he ascended into
Heaven where none can presume to deny him a
local habitation. Acts 1:9-11; Eph. 1:20;
Heb. 8:1. But Paul, speaking of this same Jesus,
says, “Who is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn of every creature.” Col. 1:15.
Here the antithesis expressed is between God
who is invisible, and his image in the person of
Christ which was visible. It follows, therefore,
that what of Christ the disciples could see, which
was his bodily form, was the image, to give them
an idea of God, whom they could not see.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again: “Let this mind be in you which was
also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of
God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
God.” Phil. 2:5, 6. It remains to be told how
Christ could be in the form of God, and yet God
have no form.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more: “God who at sundry times, and
in divers manners, spake in time past unto the
fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days
spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed
heir of all things, by whom also he made
the worlds; who being the brightness of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>glory, and the <em>express image of his person</em>,” &amp;c.
Heb. 1:1-3. This testimony is conclusive. It
is an inspired declaration that God has a personal
form; and to give an idea of what that
form is, it declares that Christ, just as we conceive
of him as ascended up bodily on high, is
the express image thereof.</p>

<p class='c011'>The evidence already presented shows that
there is no necessity for making the image of
God in which man was created to consist of anything
else but bodily form. But to whatever
else persons may be inclined to apply it, Paul in
his testimony to the Romans, forever destroys
the possibility of making it apply to immortality.
He says, Rom. 1:22, 23: “Professing themselves
to be wise, they became fools, and changed the
glory of the uncorruptible God into an image
made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and
fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.” The
word here rendered uncorruptible is the same
word that is translated immortal and applied to
God in 1 Tim. 1:17. Now if God by making
man in <a id='corr30.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hisim age'>his image</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_30.23'><ins class='correction' title='hisim age'>his image</ins></a></span> stamped him with immortality,
man is just as incorruptible as God himself.
But Paul says that he is not so; that while God
is uncorruptible or immortal, man is corruptible
or mortal. The image of God does not therefore,
confer immortality.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IV. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE BREATH OF LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Gen. 1:27, states, in general terms, the form
in which man was created, as contrasted with
other orders of animal life. In Gen. 2:7, the
process is described by which this creation was
accomplished. Finding no proof in the former
passage that man was put in possession of immortality
(see preceding chapter) we turn to the
latter text to examine the claims based upon
that. The verse reads: “And the Lord God
formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life: and
man became a living soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here the advocates of man’s natural immortality
endeavor to make a strong stand, as it is very
proper they should do; for certainly if in that inspired
record which describes the building up of
man, the putting together of the different parts or
constituent elements of which he is composed, there
is no testimony that he was clothed with immortality,
and no hook furnished upon which an argument
for such an attribute can be hung, their
whole system is shaken to its very foundation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The claim based upon this passage is that man
is composed of two parts: the body formed of the
dust of the ground, and an immortal soul placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>therein by God’s breathing into the nostrils of
that dust-formed body the breath of life. We
will let two representative men speak on this
point, and state the popular view. Thomas
Scott, D. D., on Gen. 2:7, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The Lord not only gave man life in common with the
other animals which had bodies formed of the same materials;
but immediately communicated from himself the
<em>rational soul</em>, here denoted by the <em>expression of breathing
into his nostrils the breath of life</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Adam Clarke, LL. D., on Gen. 2:7, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“In the most distinct manner God shows us that man
is a compound being, having a body and soul distinctly
and separately created, the body out of the dust of the
earth, <em>the soul immediately breathed from God himself</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Critics speak of this expression in a different
manner from theologians; for whereas the latter
make it confer immortality, and raise man in this
respect to the same plane with his Maker, the
former speak of it as suggestive of man’s frail
nature, and his precarious tenure of life itself.
Thus Dr. Conant says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“In whose nostrils is breath. Only breath, so frail a
principle of life, and so easily extinguished.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>And in a note on Isa. 2:22, where the prophet
says, “Cease ye from man whose breath is in his
nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?”
he adds:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Not as in the common English version, ‘whose breath
is in his nostrils;’ for where else should it be? The objection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>is not to its place in the body, which is the proper
one for it, but to its <em>frail and perishable nature</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>To the same intent the psalmist speaks, Ps.
146:3, 4: “Put not your trust in princes, nor in
the son of man, in whom there is no help. <em>His
breath goeth forth</em>, he returneth to his earth; in
that very day his thoughts perish.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But let us examine the claim that the “breath
of life” which God breathed into man conferred
upon him the attribute of immortality. There
was nothing naturally immortal, certainly, in the
dust of which Adam was composed. Whatever
of immortality he had, therefore, after receiving
the breath of life, must have existed in that
breath in itself considered. Hence, it must follow
that the “breath of life” confers immortality
upon any creature to which it is given. Will
our friends accept this issue? If not, they abandon
the argument; for certainly it can confer no
more upon man than upon any other being.
And if they do accept it, we will introduce to
them a class of immortal associates not very flattering
to their vanity nor to their argument; for
Moses applies the very same expression to all the
lower orders of the animal creation.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Gen. 7:15, we read: “And they went in
unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh,
wherein is the breath of life.” It must be evident
to every one, at a glance, that the whole
animal creation, including man, is comprehended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>in the phrase “all flesh.” But verses 21 and 22
contain stronger expressions still: “And all flesh
died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the face of the earth,
and every man. <em>All in whose nostrils was the
breath of life</em>, of all that was in the dry land,
died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here the different orders of animals are named,
and man is expressly mentioned with them; and
all alike are said to have had in their nostrils the
breath of life. It matters not that we are not
told in the case of the lower animals how this
breath was conferred, as in the case of man; for
the immortality, if there is any in this matter,
must reside, as we have seen, in the breath itself,
not in the manner of its bestowal; and here it is
affirmed that all creatures possess it; and of the
animals, it is declared, as well as of man, that it
resides in their nostrils.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is objected that in Gen. 2:7, the “breath of
life” as applied to man is plural, “breath of lives”
(see Clarke), meaning both animal life, and that
immortality which is the subject of our investigation.
But, we reply, it is the same form in Gen.
7:22, where it is applied to all animals; and if
the reader will look at the margin of this latter
text he will see that the expression is stronger
still, “the breath of the spirit of life” or of lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>The language which Solomon uses respecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>both men and beasts strongly expresses their
common mortality: “For that which befalleth
the sons of men, befalleth beasts; even one thing
befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
other; yea, <em>they have all one breath</em>; so that a
man [in this respect] hath no pre-eminence
above a beast; for all is vanity. All go unto
one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
dust again.” Eccl. 3:19, 20.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the advocates of natural immortality
by appealing to Moses’ record respecting the
breath of life, are crushed beneath the weight of
their own arguments; for if “the breath of life”
proves immortality for man, it must prove the
same for every creature to which it is given.
The Bible affirms that all orders of the animal
creation that live upon the land, possess it.
Hence our opponents are bound to concede the
immortality of birds, beasts, bugs, beetles, and
every creeping thing. We are sometimes accused
of bringing man down by our argument to
a level with the beast. What better is this argument
of our friends which brings beasts and
reptiles up to a level with man? We deny the
charge that we are doing the one, and shall be
pardoned for declining to do the other.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER V. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE LIVING SOUL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Finding no immortality for man in the breath
of life which God breathed into man’s nostrils at
the commencement of his mysterious existence,
it remains to inquire if it resides in the “living
soul,” which man, as the result of that action,
immediately became. “And the Lord God
formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and
man became a living soul.” Gen. 2:7.</p>

<p class='c011'>On this point also it is proper to let the representatives
of the popular view define their position.
Prof. H. Mattison, on the verse just
quoted, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“That this act was the infusion of a spiritual nature
into the body of Adam, is evident from the following considerations:
The phrase, ‘breath of life,’ is rendered
breath of lives by all Hebrew scholars. Not only did animal
life then begin, but another and higher life which
constituted him not only a mere animal, but a ‘living
soul.’ He was a body before,--he is now more than a
body, a soul and body united. If he was a ‘soul’ before,
then how could he become such by the last act of
creation? And if he was not a soul before, but now became
one, then the soul must have been superadded to
his former material nature.”--<cite>Discussion with Storrs</cite>, p.
14.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Clarke, on Gen. 2:7, says:--</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“In the most distinct manner God shows us that man
is a <em>compound</em> being, having a body and soul distinctly
and separately created; the body out of the dust of the
earth, the soul immediately breathed from God himself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>To the same end see the reasonings of Landis,
Clark (D. W.), and others. Aware of the importance
to their system of maintaining this interpretation,
they very consistently rally to its
support the flower of their strength. It is the
redan of their works, and they cannot be blamed
for being unwilling to surrender it without a decisive
struggle. For if there is nothing in the
inspired record of the formation of man, that record
which undertakes to give us a correct view
of his nature, to show that he is endowed with
immortality, their system is not only shaken to
its foundation, but even the foundation itself is
swept entirely away.</p>

<p class='c011'>The vital point, to which they bend all their
energies, is somehow to show that a distinct entity,
an intelligent part, an immortal soul, was
brought near to that body as it lay there perfect
in its organization, and thrust therein, which immediately
began through the eyes of that body
to see, through its ears to hear, through its lips
to speak, and through its nerves to feel. Query:
Was this soul capable of performing all these
functions before it entered the body? If it was,
why thrust it within this prison house? If it
was not, will it be capable of performing them
after it leaves the body?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Heavy drafts are made on rhetoric in favor of
this superadded soul. Figures of beauty are
summoned to lend to the argument their aid.
An avalanche of flowers is thrown upon it, to
adorn its strength, or perchance to hide its weakness.
But when we search for the logic, we find
it a chain of sand. Right at the critical point,
the argument fails to connect; and so after all
their expenditure of effort, after all their lofty
flights, and sweating toil, their conclusion comes
out--blank assumption. Why? Because they
are endeavoring to reach a result which they
are dependent upon the text to establish, but
which the text directly contradicts. The record
does not say that God formed a body, and put
therein a superadded soul, to use that body as
an instrument; but he formed <em>man</em> of the dust.
That which was formed of the dust was the man
himself, not simply an instrument for the man to
use when he should be put therein. Adam was
just as essentially a man before the breath of life
was imparted, as after that event. This was the
difference: before, he was a dead man; afterward,
a living one. The organs were all there ready
for their proper action. It only needed the vitalizing
principle of the breath of life to set them
in motion. That came, and the lungs began to
expand, the heart to beat, the blood to flow, and
the limbs to move; then was exhibited all the
phenomena of physical action; then, too, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>brain began to act, and there was exhibited all
the phenomena of mental action, perception,
thought, memory, will, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>The engine is an engine before the motive
power is applied. The bolts, bars, pistons,
cranks, shafts, and wheels, are all there. The
parts designed to move are ready for action. But
all is silent and still. Apply the steam, and it
springs, as it were, into a thing of life, and gives
forth all its marvelous exhibitions of celerity and
power.</p>

<p class='c011'>So with man. When the breath of life was
imparted, which, as we have seen was given in
common to all the animal creation, that simply
was applied which set the machine in motion.
No separate and independent organization was
added, but a change took place in the man himself.
The man <em>became</em> something, or reached a
condition which before he had not attained. The
verb “became” is defined by Webster, “to pass
from one state to another; to enter into some
state or condition, by a change from another state
or condition, or by assuming or receiving new
properties or qualities, additional matter or a new
character.” And Gen. 2:7, is then cited as an
illustration of this definition. But it will be
seen that none of these will fit the popular idea
of the superadded soul; for that is not held to
be simply a change in Adam’s condition, or a
new property or quality of his being, or an addition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of matter, or a new character; but a separate
and independent entity, capable, without the
body, of a higher existence than with it. The
boy becomes a man; the acorn, an oak; the egg,
an eagle; the chrysalis, a butterfly; but the capabilities
of the change all inhere in the object
which experiences it. A superadded, independent
soul could not have been put into man, and
be said to have <em>become</em> that soul. Yet it is said
of Adam, that he, on receiving the breath of life,
<em>became</em> a living soul. An engine is put into a
ship, and by its power propels it over the face of
the deep; but the ship, by receiving the engine,
does not become the engine, nor the engine the
ship. No sophistry, even from the darkest
depths of its alchemy, can bring up and attach to
the word “become” a definition which will make
it mean, as applied to any body, the addition of
a distinct and separate organization to that
body.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the inquiry of Prof. Mattison, “If he was ‘a
soul’ before, then how could he become such by
the last act of creation,” it may be replied, The
antithesis is not based upon the word soul, but
upon the word living. This will become evident
by trying to read the passage without this word:
“And the Lord God breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life, and man became a soul.” That
is not it. He became a <em>living</em> soul. He was a
soul before, but not a living soul. To thus speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of a dead soul, may provoke from some a sneer;
nevertheless, the Hebrews so used the terms.
See Num. 6:6: “He shall come at no dead body,”
on which Cruden says, “in Hebrew, dead soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Kitto, in his Relig. Encyclopedia, under the
term Adam, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“And Jehovah God formed the man (Heb., the Adam)
dust from the ground, and blew into his nostrils the
breath of life, and man became a <em>living animal</em>. Some of
our readers may be surprised at our having translated
<em>nephesh chaiyah</em> by living animal. There are good interpreters
and preachers who, confiding in the common
translation, living soul, have maintained that here is intimated
a distinctive pre-eminence above the inferior animals,
as possessed of an immaterial and immortal spirit.
But, however true that distinction is, and supported by
abundant argument from both philosophy and the Scriptures,
we should be acting unfaithfully if we were to assume
its being <em>contained</em> or <em>implied</em> in this passage.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The “abundant argument from both philosophy
and the Scriptures” for man’s immortal
spirit, may be more difficult to find than many
suppose. But this admission that nothing of the
kind is implied in this passage, is a gratifying
triumph of fair and candid criticism over what
has been almost universally believed and taught.</p>

<p class='c011'>But we are not left to our own reasoning on
this point; for inspiration itself has given us a
comment upon the passage in question; and certainly
it is safe to let one inspired writer explain
the words of another.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Paul, in 1 Cor. 15:44, and onward, is contrasting
the first Adam with the second, and our present
state with the future. He says: “There is a
natural body and there is a spiritual body. And
so it is written, The first man Adam was made a
living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening
spirit.” Here Paul refers directly to the facts
recorded in Gen. 2:7. In verse 47, he tells us
the nature of this man that was made a living
soul: “The first man is of the earth, earthy; the
second man is the Lord from Heaven.” In verse
49, he says, “And as we have borne the image of
the earthy,” have been, like Adam, living souls,
“we shall also bear the image of the heavenly,”
when our bodies are fashioned like unto his glorious
body. Phil. 3:21. In verses 50 and 53,
he tells us why it is necessary that this should
be done, and how it will be accomplished: “Now
this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption
inherit incorruption. For this corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Putting these declarations all together, what
do we have? We have a very explicit statement
that this first man, this living soul which Adam
was made, was of the earth, earthy, did not bear
the image of the heavenly in its freedom from a
decaying nature, did not possess that incorruption
without which we cannot inherit the kingdom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>God, but was wholly mortal and corruptible.
Would people allow these plain and weighty
words of the apostle their true meaning upon
this question, it would not only summarily arrest
all controversy over the particular text under
consideration, but leave small ground, at least
from the teachings of the Scriptures, to argue for
the natural immortality of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the terms “living soul” like the breath of
life, are applied to all orders of the animate creation,
to beasts and reptiles, as well as to man.
The Hebrew words are <em>nephesh chaiyah</em>; and
these words are in the very first chapter of Genesis
four times applied to the lower orders of animals:
Gen. 1:20, 21, 24, 30. On Gen. 1:21, Dr.
A. Clarke offers this comment:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Nephesh chaiyah</em>; a general term to express all creatures
endued with animal life, in any of its infinitely varied
gradations, from the half-reasoning elephant down to
the stupid potto, or lower still, to the polype, which seems
equally to share the vegetable and animal life.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>This is a valuable comment on the meaning of
these words. He would have greatly enhanced
the utility of that information, if he had told us
that the same words are applied to man in Gen.
2:7.</p>

<p class='c011'>Prof. Bush, in his notes on this latter text,
says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The phrase living soul is in the foregoing narrative
repeatedly applied to the inferior orders of animals which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>are not considered to be possessed of a ‘soul’ in the sense
in which that term is applied to man. It would seem to
mean the same, therefore, when spoken of man, that it
does when spoken of beasts, viz.: an animated being, a
creature possessed of life and sensation, and capable of
performing all the physical functions by which animals are
distinguished, as eating, drinking, walking, &amp;c....
Indeed it may be remarked that the Scriptures generally
afford much less <em>explicit</em> evidence of the existence of a
sentient immaterial principle in man, capable of living
and acting separate from the body, than is usually supposed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>And there is nothing in the term “living” to
imply that the life with which Adam was then
endowed would continue forever; for these living
souls are said to die. Rev. 16:3: “And every
living soul died in the sea.” Whether this means
men navigating its surface or the animals living
in its waters, it is equally to the point as showing
that that which is designated by the terms
“living soul,” whatever it is, is subject to death.</p>

<p class='c011'>Staggered by the fact (and unable to conceal
it) that the terms “living soul” are applied to
all animals, the advocates of man’s immortality
then undertake to make the word “became” the
pivot of their argument. Man “became” a living
soul, but it is not said of the beasts that they
became such; hence this must denote the addition
of something to man which the animals did
not receive. And in their anxiety to make this
appear, they surreptitiously insert the idea that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>the animal life of man is derived from the dust
of the ground, and that something of a higher
nature was imparted to man by the breath of
life which was breathed into him, and the living
soul which he became. Thus Mr. Landis, in his
work, “The Immortality of the Soul,”<a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c014'><sup>[A]</sup></a> p. 141,
says: “Hence something was to be added to the
mere animal life derived from the dust of the
ground.” Now Mr. L. ought to know, and knowing,
ought to have the candor to admit, that no
life at all is derived from the dust of the ground.
All the life that Adam had was imparted by the
breath of life which God breathed into his nostrils,
which breath all breathing animals, no matter
how they obtained it, possessed as well as he.</p>

518 pages, and being issued under the patronage of the great
Methodist Book Concern, we take it to be a representative work,
and shall occasionally refer to its positions.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>No emphasis can be attached to the word “became:”
for everything that is called a living soul
must by some process have become such. “Whatever
was or is first <em>became</em> what it was or is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Take the case of Eve. She was formed of a
rib of Adam, made of pre-existent matter. It is
not said of her that God breathed into her nostrils
the breath of life, or that she became a living
soul; yet no one claims that her nature was
essentially different from that of Adam with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>whom she was associated, as a fitting companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it will be further seen that this word “became”
can have no value in the argument, unless
the absurd principle be first set up as truth, that
whatever becomes anything must forever remain
what it has become.</p>

<p class='c011'>Defenders of the popular view, by such reasoning
reduce their argument to its last degree of attenuation;
but here its assumption becomes so
transparent that it has no longer power to mislead,
and needs no further reply.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> <span class='fss'>WHAT IS SOUL? WHAT IS SPIRIT?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The discussion of Gen. 2:7 (as in the preceding
chapter), brings directly before us for solution
the question, What is meant by the terms soul
and spirit, as applied to man? Some believers
in unconditional immortality point triumphantly
to the fact that the terms soul and spirit are
used in reference to the human race, as though
that settled the question, and placed an insuperable
embargo upon all further discussion. This
arises simply from their not looking into this
matter with sufficient thoroughness to see that
all we question in the case is the popular definition
that is given to these terms. We do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>deny that man has a soul and spirit; we only
say that if our friends will show that the Bible
anywhere attaches to them the meaning with
which modern theology has invested them, they
will supply what has thus far been a perpetual
lack, and forever settle this controversy.</p>

<p class='c011'>What do theologians tell us these terms signify?
Buck, in his Theological Dictionary, says:
“Soul, that vital, immaterial, active substance or
principle in man whereby he perceives, remembers,
reasons, and wills.” On spirit, he says:
“An incorporeal being or intelligence; in which
sense God is said to be a spirit, as are the angels
and the human soul.” On man, he says: “The
constituent and essential parts of man created by
God are two: body and soul. The one was
made out of dust; the other was breathed into
him.” This soul, he further says, “is a spiritual
substance;” and then, apparently feeling not
exactly safe in calling that a <em>substance</em> which he
claims to be <em>immaterial</em>, he bewilders it by saying
“subsistence,” and then adds, “immaterial,
immortal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This position strikes us as considerably open
to criticism. On this definition of “soul,” how
can we deny it to the lower animals? for they
“perceive, remember, reason, and will.” And, if
spirit means the “human soul,” the question
arises, Has man two immortal elements in his
nature? for the Bible applies both terms to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>at the same time. Paul, to the Thessalonians,
says: “And I pray God your whole spirit and
soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Does Paul
here use tautology, by applying to man two
terms meaning the same thing? That would be
a serious charge against his inspiration. Then
has man two immortal parts, soul and spirit
both? This would evidently be overdoing the
matter; for, where one is enough, two are a
burden. And further, on this hypothesis, would
these two immortal parts exist hereafter as two
independent and separate beings?</p>

<p class='c011'>This idea being preposterous, one question
more remains: Which of these two is the immortal
part? Is it the soul or the spirit? It
cannot be both; and it matters not to us which
is the one chosen. But we want to know what
the decision is between the two. If they say
that what we call the soul is the immortal part,
then they give up such texts as Eccl. 12:7:
“The spirit shall return to God who gave it;”
and Luke 23:46, “Into thy hands I commend
my spirit,” &amp;c. On the other hand, if they claim
that it is the spirit which is the immortal part,
then they give up such texts as Gen. 35:18:
“And it came to pass as her soul was in departing
(for she died);” and 1 Kings 17:21, “Let
this child’s soul come into him again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, further, if the body and soul are both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span><em>essential</em> parts of man, as Mr. B. affirms, how
can either exist as a distinct, conscious, and perfect
being without the other?</p>

<p class='c011'>Foreseeing these difficulties, Smith, in his Bible
Dictionary, distinguishes between soul and
spirit thus: “Soul (Heb. <em>nephesh</em>, Gr. ψυχὴ).
One of three parts of which man was anciently
believed to consist. The term ψυχὴ, is sometimes
used to denote the vital principle, sometimes the
sentient principle, or seat of the senses, desires,
affections, appetites, passions. In the latter
sense, it is distinguished from πνευμα [<em>pneuma</em>],
the higher rational nature. This distinction appears
in the Septuagint, and sometimes in the
New Testament. 1 Thess. 5:23.” Then he
quotes Olshausen on 1 Thess. 5:23, as saying:
“For whilst the ψυχὴ [soul] denotes the lower
region of the spiritual man,--comprises, therefore,
the powers to which analogous ones are
found in <em>animal</em> life also, as understanding,
appetitive faculty, memory, fancy,--the πνευμα
[<em>pneuma</em>] includes those capacities which constitute
the true human life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So it seems that, according to these expositors,
while the Hebrew <em>nephesh</em>, and Greek <em>psuche</em>,
usually translated soul, denote powers common
to all animal life, the Hebrew <em>ruach</em>, and the
corresponding Greek <em>pneuma</em>, signify the higher
powers, and consequently that part which is supposed
to be immortal.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Now let us inquire what meaning the sacred
writers attach to these terms. As already stated,
the original words from which soul and spirit are
translated, are, for soul, <em>nephesh</em> in the Hebrew,
and <em>psuche</em> in the Greek, and for spirit, <em>ruach</em> in
the Hebrew, and <em>pneuma</em> in the Greek. To
these no one is at liberty to attach any arbitrary
meaning. We must determine their signification
by the sense in which they are used in the sacred
record; and whoever goes beyond that, does violence
to the word of God.</p>

<p class='c011'>The word <em>nephesh</em> occurs 745 times in the Old
Testament, and is translated by the term soul
about 473 times. In every instance in the Old
Testament where the word soul occurs, it is from
<em>nephesh</em>, with the exception of Job 30:15, where
it comes from <i>n’dee-vah</i>, and Isa. 57:16, where
it is from <i>n’shah-mah</i>. But the mere use of the
word soul determines nothing; for it cannot be
claimed to signify an immortal part, until we
somewhere find immortality affirmed of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides the word soul, <em>nephesh</em>, is translated life
and lives, as in Gen. 1:20, 30, in all 118 times. It
is translated person, as in Gen. 14:21, in all 29
times. It is translated mind, as in Gen. 23:8, in
all 15 times. It is translated heart, as in Ex.
23:9, in all 15 times. It is translated body, or
dead body, as in Num. 6:6, in all 11 times. It
is translated will, as in Ps. 27:12, in all 4 times.
It is translated appetite, as in Prov. 23:2, twice;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>lust, as in Ps. 78:18, twice; thing, as in Lev.
11:10, twice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides the foregoing, it is rendered by the
various pronouns, and by the words, breath,
beast, fish, creature, ghost, pleasure, desire, &amp;c.,
in all forty-three different ways. <em>Nephesh</em> is
never rendered spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>This soul (<em>nephesh</em>) is represented as in danger
of the grave, Ps. 49:14, 15; 89:88; Job 33:18,
20, 22; Isa. 38:17. It is also spoken of as liable
to be destroyed, killed, &amp;c., Gen. 17:14; Ex. 31:14;
Josh. 10:30, 32, 35, 37, 39, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>Parkhurst, author of a Greek and a Hebrew
Lexicon, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“As a noun, <em>neh-phesh</em> hath been supposed to signify
the spiritual part of man, or what we commonly call his
soul. I must for myself confess that I can find no passage
where it hath undoubtedly this meaning. Gen. 35:18;
<a id='corr51.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='1 Kings 17, 21, 22'>1 Kings 17:21, 22</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_51.19'><ins class='correction' title='1 Kings 17, 21, 22'>1 Kings 17:21, 22</ins></a></span>; Ps. 16:10, seem fairest for this
signification. But may not <em>neh-phesh</em>, in the three former
passages, be most properly rendered <em>breath</em>, and in the
last, a breathing, or animal frame?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Taylor, author of a Hebrew Concordance, says that
<em>neh-phesh</em> “signifies the animal life, or that principle by
which every animal, according to its kind, lives. Gen.
1:20, 24, 30; Lev. 11:40. Which animal life, so far as
we know anything of the manner of its existence, or so
far as the Scriptures lead our thoughts, consists in the
<em>breath</em>, Job. 41:21; 31:39, and in the <em>blood</em>. Lev. 17:11,
14.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Gesenius, the standard Hebrew lexicographer,
defines <em>nephesh</em> as follows:--</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“1. Breath. 2. The vital spirit, as the Greek <em>psuche</em>,
and Latin <em>anima</em>, through which the body lives, <em>i. e.</em>, the
principle of life manifested in the breath.” To this he
also ascribes “whatever has respect to the sustenance of
life by food and drink, and the contrary.” “3. The
rational soul, mind, <em>animus</em>, as the seat of feelings, affections,
and emotions. 4. Concr. living thing, animal in
which is the <em>nephesh</em>, life.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The word soul in the New Testament comes
invariably from the Greek ψυχή (<em>psuche</em>); which
word occurs 105 times. It is translated soul 58
times; life, 40 times; mind, 3 times; heart,
twice; us, once; and you, once.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spirit in the Old Testament is from two Hebrew
words <i>n’shah-mah</i> and <em>ruach</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The former occurs 24 times. It is 17 times
rendered breath, 3 times, blast, twice, spirit, once,
soul, and once, inspiration. It is defined by Gesenius,
“Breath, spirit, spoken of the breath of
God, <em>i. e.</em>, <em>a</em>) the wind, <em>b</em>) the breath, breathing of
his anger. 2. Breath, life of man and beasts. 3.
The mind, the intellect. 4. Concr. living thing,
animals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter, <em>ruach</em>, occurs 442 times. Spirit in
every instance in the Old Testament is from this
word, except Job 26:4, and Prov. 20:27; where
it is from <i>n’shah-mah</i>. Besides spirit it is translated
wind 97 times, breath, 28 times, smell, 8
times, mind, 6 times, blast, 4 times; also anger,
courage, smell, air, &amp;c., in all sixteen different
ways.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Spirit in the New Testament is from the Greek,
πνεῦμα (<em>pneuma</em>) in every instance. The original
word occurs 385 times, and besides spirit is rendered
ghost 92 times, wind, once, and life, once.
Parkhurst in his Greek Lexicon, says: “It may
be worth remarking that the leading sense of the
old English word ghost is breath; ... that
ghost is evidently of the same root with <em>gust</em> of
wind; and that both these words are plain derivatives
from the Hebrew, to move with violence;
whence also <em>gush</em>, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Pneuma</em> is defined by Robinson in his Greek
Lexicon of the New Testament, to mean, primarily,
“1. A breathing, breath, breath of air, air in
motion. 2. The spirit of man, <em>i. e.</em>, the vital
spirit, life, soul, the principle of life residing in
the breath breathed into men from God, and
again returning to God.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We now have before us the use and definitions
of the words from which soul and spirit are translated.
From the facts presented we learn that a
large variety of meanings attaches to them; and
that we are at liberty wherever they occur to
give them that definition which the sense of the
context requires. But when a certain meaning
is attached to either of these words in one place,
it is not saying that it has the same meaning in
every other place.</p>

<p class='c011'>By a dishonorable perversion on this point
some have tried to hold up to ridicule the advocates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of the view we here defend. Thus, when
we read in Gen. 2:7, that Adam became a living
soul, the sense demands, and the meaning of the
word soul will warrant, that we then apply it to
the whole person; Adam, as a complete being,
was a living soul. But when we read in Gen.
35:18, “And it came to pass, as her soul was in
departing, for she died,” we give the word, according
to another of its definitions, a more limited
signification, and apply it, with Parkhurst,
to the breath of life.</p>

<p class='c011'>But some have met us here in this manner:
“Materialists tell us that soul means the whole
man, then let us see how it will read in Gen. 35:18;
‘And it came to pass as the whole man was
in departing; for she died.’” Or they will say,
“Materialists tell us that soul means the breath;
then let us try it in Gen. 2:7: ‘And Adam became
a living breath.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such a course, while it is no credit to their
mental acumen, is utterly disastrous to all their
claims of candor and honesty in their treatment
of this important subject. While we are not at
liberty to go beyond the latitude of meaning
which is attached to the words soul and spirit,
we are at liberty to use whatever definition the
circumstances of the case require, varying of
course in different passages. But in the whole
list of definitions, and in the entire use of the
words, we find nothing answering to that immaterial,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>independent, immortal part, capable of a
conscious, intelligent, active existence out of the
body as well as in, of which the popular religious
teachers of the day endeavor to make these words
the vehicle.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now we would commend to the attention
of the reader another stupendous fact, the bearing
of which he cannot fail to appreciate. We
want to know if this soul, or spirit, is immortal.
The Hebrew and Greek words from which they
are translated, occur in the Bible, as we have
seen, <em>seventeen hundred times</em>. Surely, once at
least in that long list we shall be told that the
soul is immortal, if this is its high prerogative.
Seventeen hundred times we inquire if the soul
is once said to be immortal, or the spirit deathless.
And the invariable and overwhelming response
we meet is, <em>Not Once!</em> Nowhere, though
used so many hundred times, is the soul said to
be undying in its nature, or the spirit deathless.
Strange and unaccountable fact, if immortality
is an inseparable attribute of the soul and spirit!</p>

<p class='c011'>An attempt is sometimes made to parry the
force of this fact by saying that the immortality
of the soul, like that of God, is taken for granted.
We reply, The immortality of God is not taken
for granted. Although this might be taken for
granted if anything could be so taken, yet it is
directly asserted that God is immortal. Let now
the advocates of the soul’s natural immortality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>produce one text where it is said to have immortality,
as God is said to have it, 1 Tim. 6:16, or
where it is said to be immortal, as God is said to
be, 1 Tim. 1:17, and the question is settled. But
this cannot be done; and the ignoble shift of the
taken-for-granted argument falls dead to the
floor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VII. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE SPIRIT RETURNS TO GOD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Ecclesiastes 12:7: “Then shall the dust return
to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall
return to God who gave it.” It is natural for
men to appeal first and most directly to those
sources from which they expect the most efficient
help. So the advocates of man’s natural immortality,
when put to the task of showing what
scriptures they regard as containing proof of
their position, almost invariably make their first
appeal to the text here quoted.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the examination of this text, and all others
of a like nature, let it ever be remembered that
the question at issue is, Has man in his nature
a constituent element, which is an independent
entity, and which, when the body dies, keeps
right on in uninterrupted consciousness, being
capable of exercising in a still higher degree out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of the body the functions of intelligence and
activity which it manifested through the body,
and destined, whether a subject of God’s favor,
or of his threatened and merited wrath, to live
so long as God himself exists.</p>

<p class='c011'>Does this text assert anything of this kind?
Does it state that from which even such an inference
can be drawn? We invite the reader to
go with us, while we endeavor to consider carefully
what the text really teaches. Our opponents
appeal to it as direct testimony. Let us
see how far we can go with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. Solomon, under a series of beautiful figures,
speaks in Eccl. 12:1-7, of the lying down of man
in death. Granted.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Dust, or the body, and spirit are spoken of
as two distinct things. Granted.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. At death, the spirit leaves the body. Granted.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. The spirit is disposed of in a different manner
from the body. Granted.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. This spirit returns to God, and is therefore
conscious, after the dissolution of the body. Not
granted. Where is the proof of this? Here our
paths begin to diverge from each other. But
how could it return to God if it was not conscious?
Answer: In the manner Job describes.
“If he [God] set his heart upon man, if he gather
unto himself his spirit and his breath, all flesh
shall perish together, and man shall turn again to
dust.” Job 34:14, 15. This text speaks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>God’s gathering to himself the “breath” of man;
something which no one supposes to be capable
of a separate conscious existence. Over against
this proposition we are compelled to mark, Assumption.</p>

<p class='c011'>6. This spirit is therefore to exist forever.
This conclusion also we fail to see, either expressed,
or even in the remotest manner, implied.
Thus the vital points in the evidence are wholly
assumed.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the spirit here does not mean what it
is popularly supposed to mean, what is its signification?
What is it that returns to God? It
will be noticed that it is something which God
“gave” to man. And Solomon introduces it in
a familiar manner, as if alluding to something already
recorded and well understood. He makes
evident reference to the creation of man in the
beginning. His body was formed of the dust;
and in addition to this, what did God do for man
or give unto him? He breathed into his nostrils
the <em>breath of life</em>. This is the only spirit that is
distinctly spoken of as having been given by
God to man. No one claims that this, like the
body, was from the dust, or returns to dust; but
it does not therefore follow that it is conscious or
immortal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Landis, p. 133, falls into this wrong method of
reasoning. He says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“If the soul were mortal, it too would be given up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the dust, it would return also to the earth. But God affirms
that it does not return to the earth; and therefore
it is distinct from the mortal and perishable part of man.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The breath of life is distinct from the body,
and did not come from the dust of the ground;
but to say that it can exist in a conscious state
independent of the body, and that it must live
forever, is groundless assumption.</p>

<p class='c011'>If spirit here means “the breath of life,” how,
or in what sense, does it return to God? Landis,
p. 150, thus falsely treats this point also: “How
can the air we breathe,” he asks, “return to God?”
Between the breath of life as imparted to man by
God, vitalizing the animal frame, and air considered
simply as an element, we apprehend there
is a broad distinction. Solomon is showing the
dissolution of man by tracing back the steps
taken in his formation. The breath of life was
breathed into Adam in the beginning; by which
he became a living soul. That is withdrawn
from man, and as a consequence he becomes inanimate.
Then the body, deprived of its vitalizing
principle, having been formed of the dust,
goes back to dust again.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the breath of life came from God to man,
none will deny. Do they ask how it returns to
him? Tell us how it came from him, and we
will tell how it returns. In the same sense in
which God gave it to man, in that sense it returns
to him. That is all there is of it. The explanation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>is perfectly simple, because one division
of the problem is comprehended just as easily as
the other. It is an easy thing to turn off with a
flippant sneer an explanation which if allowed to
stand, takes the very breath of life out of a cherished
theory.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there is a grave objection lying against
the popular exposition of this text, which must
not pass unnoticed. It is involved in the question,
What was the state or condition of this
spirit before God gave it to man? Was it an independent,
conscious, and intelligent being, before
it was put into Adam, as it is claimed that
it was after Adam got through with it, and it returned
to God? Solomon evidently designs to
state respecting all the elements of which man is
composed, as is expressly stated of the body, that
they resume the original condition in which they
were, before they came together to form the component
parts of man. We know it is argued
that the expression respecting the body, that it
returns to the dust “as it was,” is good ground
for an inference that the spirit returns not as it
was. Every principle of logic requires the very
opposite conclusion. For, having set the mind
upon that idea of sameness of condition, and then
referring us to the source from whence the spirit
came, and stating that it goes back to that source,
the language is as good as an affirmation that it
goes back to its original condition also, and must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>be so understood unless an express affirmation is
made to the contrary. The question is therefore
pertinent, Was this spirit before it came into
man, a conscious being, as it is claimed to be
after it leaves him? In other words, have we
all had a conscious pre-existence? Is the mystery
of our Lord’s incarnation repeated in every
member of the human race? Yes! if popular
theologians rightly explain this text. And the
more daring or reckless spirits among them, seeing
the logical sequence of their reasoning, boldly
avow this position.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Landis (to whom we make occasional reference
as an exponent of the popular theory) recoils
at the idea of pre-existence, and claims (p.
147) that the spirit does not return as it was, but
acquires “a moral character, and so is changed
from what it was when first created and given to
man”! Oh! then, when Adam’s body was formed
of the dust of the ground a spirit <em>was created</em>
(from what?) and put into it. Where did he
learn this? To what new revelation has he
had access to become acquainted with so remarkable
a fact? Or whence derives he his authority
to manufacture statements of this kind?
His soul swells with indignation over some whom
he styles materialists, and whom he accuses of
manufacturing scripture. Thou that sayest a
man should not, dost thou? Nothing is said of
the “creation of a spirit” in connection with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>formation of Adam’s body. The body having
been formed, God, by an agency, not created for
the purpose, but already existing with himself,
endowed it with life, and Adam became a living
soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having thus artfully introduced the idea that
the spirit was created for the occasion, Mr. L.
takes up this reasoning which shows that if the
spirit is conscious after leaving the body, it must
have been before it entered it, and, applying to it
a term doubtless suggested by his own feelings
in view of the assumptions to which he was himself
obliged to resort, calls it silly. Nevertheless
here is the rock on which their exposition of this
text inevitably and hopelessly founders.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is another consideration not without its
bearing on this question. The words, “And the
spirit shall return to God who gave it,” are
spoken promiscuously of all mankind. They
apply alike to the righteous and wicked. If the
spirit survives the death of the body, the spirits
of the righteous would, as a natural consequence,
ascend to God, in whose presence they are promised
fullness of joy. But do the spirits of the
wicked go to God also? For what purpose?
The immediate destination usually assigned to
them is the lake of fire. Is it said that they first
go to God to be judged? Then we ask, Where
does the Bible once affirm that a person is judged
when he dies? On the contrary, the Scriptures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>invariably place the Judgment in the future, and
assert in the most explicit terms that God has
appointed a day for that purpose. Acts 17:31.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the Bible doctrine of the Judgment is
directly contradicted by this view. According
to the Scriptures no man has yet received his final
judgment; yet, according to the view under
examination, the spirits of all who have ever
died, good and bad, righteous and wicked, have
gone to God. For what purpose have the spirits
of the wicked gone to him? Are they there
still? Does God so deal with rebels against his
government--give them Heaven from one to six
thousand years, more or less, and hell afterward?
Away with a view which introduces such inconsistencies
into God’s dealings with his creatures.</p>

<p class='c011'>How infinitely preferable that view which
alone the record warrants; that is, that the
spirit that returns to God who gave it is the
breath of life, that agency by which God vivifies
and sustains these physical frames; since this,
so far as the record goes, is just what God did
give to man in the beginning, since the definition
of the term sustains such an application, since
this spirit, without doing violence to either
thought or language, can return to God in the
same sense in which it came from him, and,
above all, since this view harmonizes all the record,
and avoids those inconsistencies and contradictions
in which we find ourselves inevitably involved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the very moment we undertake to make
the spirit mean a separate entity, conscious in
death and immortal in its nature.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE FORMATION OF THE SPIRIT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In a search for testimony relative to the nature
of man, with the purpose of ascertaining
whether or not he is immortal, those texts first
demand attention which are claimed as proof
that he is above and beyond the power of death.
Zech. 12:1, is introduced as positive testimony on
this side of the question:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel,
saith the Lord, which stretcheth forth the
heavens and layeth the foundations of the
earth, and formeth the spirit of man within
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With an immense flourish this text is introduced
by Mr. Landis, p. 152; and with an air of
triumph he adds that materialists are in the
habit of passing it in silence. We think we can
answer for them that they have seen in it nothing
to answer, and hence have declined to spend
their time beating the air. As to the nature of
the spirit which God forms in man, its characteristics
and attributes, this text affirms nothing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Above all, respecting the main inquiry, Is this
spirit immortal? the text is entirely silent. Why
then is it introduced? Because it contains the
word spirit. But, as has been shown (chapter vi),
nothing is proved by the mere use of the words
soul and spirit, till some affirmation can be found
in the Scriptures that these terms signify an independent
entity, which has the power of uninterrupted
consciousness, and the endowment of
immortality. For men to take these terms and
give them definitions and clothe them with attributes
which are the offspring of pagan philosophy,
or figments of their own imagination, and
then claim that because the Bible uses these
terms it sustains their views, is to us, at least, a
very unsatisfactory method of settling this question.
But, from the persistency with which it is
followed by those of the opposite view, one might
conclude that it is the only way they have of
sustaining their position.</p>

<p class='c011'>God formeth the spirit of man within him.
So the text asserts. The word, form, is in the
Septuagint, <em>plasso</em>. The definition of this word,
as given by Liddell and Scott, is, “To form,
mould, shape, Lat. <em>fingere</em>, strictly used of the
artist who works in soft substances, such as
earth, clay, wax.” The word, then, signifies giving
shape and form to something already in existence;
for the artist does not create his clay,
wax, &amp;c., but only changes its form. The second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>definition seems, however, to be more applicable
to the case in hand. Thus, “II. generally, to
bring into shape or form, πλ. τὴν ψυχὴν τὸ σῶμα, to
mould and form the mind or body by care, diet,
and exercise.” Thus God makes man the crown
of creation by forming in him (through a superior
organization of the brain) an intellectual or mental
nature, and we can still further form or mold
it, by care and cultivation. There is nothing
here to favor the idea of the creation of a separate
immaterial and immortal entity, and its insertion
into the human frame.</p>

<p class='c011'>This text is illustrated by Job 32:8: “But
there is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of
the Almighty giveth them understanding;” not
“giveth it [the spirit] understanding,” as we
heard an immaterialist in debate not long since
read it; but “giveth them [the men] understanding.”
That is, men are endowed with a superior
mental organization; and by means of that God
gives them understanding.</p>

<p class='c011'>Since, however, Zech. 12:1, is used by immaterialists,
to prove that souls are specially created,
it raises the question, which may as well be
considered in this connection as any other,
whence the spirit, whatever it is, is derived. In
the text under consideration, the present tense is
evidently used for the past; and hence it might
be read, “The burden of the word of the Lord
... which stretched forth the heavens, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>laid the foundations of the earth, and <em>formed</em> the
spirit of man within him.” If now this means
the creation of an immortal entity to be added
to man, called his spirit, it applies only to the
first man, the man formed at the creation of the
world. The question then remains, How do all
succeeding members of the human race, how do
we, get an immortal spirit? Is it by a special
act of creation on the part of God, or is it by
generation from father to son? Has God, for every
member of the human race since Adam, by
special act created a soul or spirit? They who
say he has, contradict Gen. 2:2, which declares
that all God’s work of creation, so far as it pertains
to this world, was finished in the first week
of time. If this testimony is true, it is certain
that God has not been at work ever since creating
human souls as fast as bodies were brought
into existence to need them, the greater part of
the time thousands of them every day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Has God thus made himself the servant of the
human race, to wait upon their will, caprice, and
passions? for how many of the inhabitants of
this earth are the offspring of the foulest iniquity
and the most unbridled lust! Does God hold
himself in readiness to create souls which must
come from his hand immaculate and pure, to be
thrust into such vile tenements, at the bidding of
godless lust? The reader will pardon the irreverence
of the question, for the sake of an exposure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>of the absurdity of that theory which
prompts it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if we say that the soul is transmitted with
the body, then what becomes of its incorruptibility
and immortality? for “that which is born of
the flesh is flesh.” John 3:6. And Peter says
(1 Pet. 1:23-25): “Being born again, not of
corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the
word of God which liveth and abideth forever.
For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man
as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and
the flower thereof falleth away; but the word of
the Lord endureth forever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There could hardly be a plainer testimony that
man as a whole is mortal and perishable. He is
born of corruptible seed. But more than this, it
is added, “All flesh is as grass.” Should it be
said that this means simply the body, we reply
that the term flesh is frequently used in the New
Testament to signify the whole man. Thus,
Rom. 3:20: “By the deeds of the law there
shall no flesh be justified.” Paul does not here
talk about the justification of bones, sinews,
nerves and muscles; he refers to the whole responsible
man. In the same sense the term is
used in many other passages. But Peter himself,
in the passage just quoted, cuts off its application
exclusively to the body; for after saying
that “all flesh is as grass,” he continues, “and all
the glory of man as the flower of grass.” The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>glory of man must include all that there is noble
and exalted about his nature. If the soul is the
highest and most godlike part of man, it is included
in this glory; but lo! it is all like the
flower of the grass, transitory and perishable.</p>

<p class='c011'>The word mortal, which means liable to death,
occurs five times in our English version, and in
every instance is used to describe the nature of
the real man. Rom. 6:12; 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:53,
54; 2 Cor. 4:11. It occurs in the original in
one other instance (2 Cor. 5:4) where it is rendered
“mortality.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The texts usually relied on to prove that souls
are immediately created are Eccl. 12:7; Isa. 57:16;
Zech. 12:1. The first of these was examined
in the last chapter. The word translated “form”
in the last of these passages, as shown in this present
chapter, is not a word that signifies to create,
but only to put into form, mold, and fashion. Isa.
57:16, speaks of the souls which God has made.
But there are numerous other texts, as Job 10:8-11;
Isa. 44:2; 64:8; Jer. 1:5, &amp;c., which
speak in the same manner of the body. But if
such expressions can be used with respect to the
body, produced by the natural process of generation,
the same expression with reference to the
soul contains no proof that that is not also transmitted
with the body.</p>

<p class='c011'>God said to our first parents, and the commission
was repeated to Noah after the flood, “Be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>fruitful and multiply.” Multiply what? Themselves,
of course. Did that mean that they should
multiply bodies, and God would multiply souls to
fit them? Nothing of the kind; but they were
to multiply beings having all the characteristics,
endowments, and attributes of themselves. So
Adam, Gen. 5:3, “begat a son in his own likeness,
after his image, and called his name Seth.”
This son was like Adam in all respects, having
all the natures that Adam possessed; and
that which was begotten by Adam was called
Seth. But according to the doctrine of creationism,
Adam begat only a body, and God created a
soul, which is the real man, and called his name
Seth, and put it into that body. Neither this
text nor any other gives countenance to any
such absurdity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some prominent theologians, both ancient and
modern, have adopted the doctrine of traduction
as opposed to that of creationism, believing the
latter to be contrary to philosophy and revelation,
but the former to be in harmony with both.
In Wesley’s Journal, Vol. v., p. 10, is found the
following entry:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“I read and abridged an old work on the origin of
the soul. I never before saw anything on the subject so
satisfactory. I think the author proves to a demonstration
that God has enabled man, as all other creatures, to
propagate his whole specie, consisting of soul and body.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The testimony of Richard Watson (Institutes,
pp. 362, 3) is equally explicit. He says:--</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“A question as to the transmission of this corruption
of nature from parents to children has been debated
among those who, nevertheless, admit the fact; some
contending that the soul is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ex traduce</em></span>; others that it is by
immediate creation. It is certain that, as to the metaphysical
part of this question, we can come to no satisfactory
conclusion. The Scriptures, however, appear to
be more in favor of traduction. ‘Adam begat a son in his
own likeness.’ ‘That which is born of the flesh is flesh,’
which refers certainly to the soul as well as to the body....
The tenet of the soul’s descent appears to have
most countenance from the language of Scripture, and it
is no small confirmation of it, that when God designed to
incarnate his own Son, he stepped out of the ordinary
course, and formed a sinless human nature immediately
by the power of the Holy Ghost.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The evidence is thus rendered conclusive from
both reason and Scripture, that the soul is transmitted
through the process of generation with
the body. What then, we ask again, becomes of
its immortality? For “that which is born of
the flesh is flesh,” and mortality cannot generate
itself to a higher plane and beget immortality.
This is not saying that mind is matter; for the
results of organization are not to be confounded
with the matter of which the organization is
composed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IX. <br /> <span class='fss'>WHO KNOWETH?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>With these words Solomon introduces, in Eccl.
3:21, a very important question respecting the
spirit of man. He says: “Who knoweth the
spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit
of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?”
Deeming this a good foundation, the advocates
of natural immortality proceed to build thereon.
They take it to be, first, a positive declaration
that the spirit of man does go up, and the spirit
of the beast downward to the earth. Then the
superstructure is easily erected: Thus, Solomon
must have believed that man had a spirit capable
of a separate and conscious existence in death;
and this spirit, in the hour of dissolution, ascends
up on high, and goes into the presence of God.
It therefore survives the stroke of death, and is
consequently immortal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here they rest their argument; but we would
like to have them proceed; for the text speaks
of the spirit of the beast, which must also be
disposed of. If the spirit of man, because it
separates from him and goes up, is conscious, is
not the spirit of the beast, because it separates
from it and goes down, conscious also? There is
nothing in the man’s spirit going up which can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>by any means show it to be conscious, any more
than there is in the spirit of the beast going
down, to show it to be conscious. But, if the
spirit of the beast survives the stroke of death,
it has just as much immortality as that of man.
This line of argument, therefore, proves too much,
and must be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c011'>But is not the word spirit as applied to the
beast a different word in the original from the
one translated spirit and applied to man? No;
they are both from the same original word; and
that word is <em>ruach</em>, the word from which spirit
is translated in the Old Testament in every instance
with two exceptions. The beast has the
same spirit that man has.</p>

<p class='c011'>Landis (p. 146) feels the weight of the stunning
blow which this fact gives to the popular view,
and endeavors to parry its force by the following
desperate resort: He says that Solomon is here
describing the state of doubt and perplexity
through which he had formerly passed; and, to
use Mr. L.’s own words, “in this perplexity he
attributes to both man and beast a <em>ruach</em>.” But
he says that Solomon got over this state of doubt
and uncertainty, and “never again attributed a
<em>ruach</em> to beasts.” What we regard as the Bible
view of man’s nature is not unfrequently denominated
infidelity by the popular theologians of
the present day; but it strikes us as rather a
bold position to go back and accuse the sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>writers of laboring under a spirit of infidelity
when they penned these sentiments.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if we take Solomon’s words to be a declaration
that the spirit of man does go up, his
question, even then, would imply a strong affirmation
that we are ignorant of its essential qualities.
Who knoweth this spirit? Who can tell
its nature? Who can describe its inherent
characteristics? Who can tell how long it shall
continue to exist? On these vital points, the
text is entirely silent, granting all that is claimed
for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, further, if this text asserts that the spirit
of man goes up to God, it will be noticed that
it is spoken promiscuously of all mankind.
Then the same queries would arise respecting the
spirits of the wicked, for what purpose they go
to God, and the same objections would lie against
that view that were stated in the examination of
Eccl. 12:7, in chapter vii.</p>

<p class='c011'>To arrive, however, at the correct meaning of
Eccl. 3:21, a brief examination of the context
is necessary. In verse 18, Solomon expresses a
desire that the sons of men may see that they
themselves are beasts. Not that he intended to
be understood that man is in no respect superior
to a beast; for no one, inspired or not, above the
level of an idiot, would make such an assertion,
in view of man’s more perfect organization, his
reasoning faculties, and, above all, his future
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>prospects, if righteous. He simply means, as
plainly expressed in the next verse, that in one
respect, namely, their dissolution in death, man
possesses no superiority over the other orders of
animated existence. “For,” he says, “that which
befalleth the sons of men, befalleth beasts; even
one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth [here
is the point of similarity], so dieth the other;
yea, they have all one breath [<em>ruach</em>, the same
word that is rendered spirit in verse 21]; so that
a man [in this respect] hath no pre-eminence
above a beast. All go unto one place [is that
place Heaven? and is this a declaration that all,
men and beasts alike, go there?] all are of the
dust, and all turn to dust again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus definite and positive is the teaching of
Solomon that in respect to their life here upon
earth, and their condition in death, men and
beasts are exactly alike; and now can we suppose
that, after having thus clearly expressed his
views of this matter, he proceeds in the very
next sentence to contradict it all, and assert that
in death there is a difference between men and
beasts, that men do have a pre-eminence, that all
do <em>not</em> go to one place, that the spirit of man
goes up conscious to God, and the spirit of the
beast goes down to perish in the earth? This
would be to make the wisest man that ever
lived, the most stupid reasoner that ever put
pen to paper.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>How, then, is his language in verse 21 to be
understood? Answer: Understand it as a question
whether the spirit of man goes up, and the
spirit of the beast down, as some asserted in opposition
to the views which he taught. John
Milton, author of Paradise Lost, so translates it:
“Who knoweth the spirit of man [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>an sursum ascendat</em></span>]
<em>whether</em> it goeth upward?” &amp;c. The
Douay Bible renders the passage thus: “Who
knoweth <em>if</em> the spirit of the children of Adam
ascend upward, and <em>if</em> the spirit of the beasts
descend downward?” The Septuagint, the Vulgate,
the Chaldee Paraphrase, the Syriac, and
the German of Luther, give the same reading.</p>

<p class='c011'>This puts the matter in quite a different light,
and saves Solomon from self-contradiction; but,
alas for the immaterialist! it completely overturns
the structure of immortality built thereon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The notion prevailed in the heathen world that
man’s spirit ascended up to be with the gods, but
the spirit of the beast went down to the earth.
It was the old lesson taught by that unreliable
character. in Eden, “Ye shall not surely die,”
but “ye shall be as gods.” Solomon contradicts
this by stating the truth in the case, that death
reduces man and beast alike to one common condition.
Then he asks, Who knows that the opposite
heathen doctrine is true, that the spirit of
man goes up, and that of the beast down? He
had declared that they all went to one place, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>accordance with God’s original sentence, “Thou
shalt surely die;” now he calls for evidence, if
there be any, to show that the opposite doctrine
is true. Thus he smites to the ground this pagan
notion by putting it to the proof of its claims,
for which no proof exists.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is another class of expressions respecting
the word spirit, which properly come under consideration
at this point. The first is Ps. 31:5,
where David says: “Into thine hand I commit
my spirit.” Our Lord used similar language,
perhaps borrowed from this expression of David,
when, expiring on the cross, he said, “Father,
into thy hands I commend my spirit.” Luke 23:46.
And Stephen, the martyr, in the same line
of thought, put up this expiring prayer: “Lord
Jesus, receive my spirit.” Acts 7:59. What
was it which David and our Lord wished to
commit into the hands of God, and Stephen, into
the hands of Christ? A conscious entity it is
claimed, the living and immortal part of man;
for nothing less could properly be committed to
God. Thus Mr. Landis (p. 131) asks: “What
was it then? The mere life which passed into
nonentity at death? And can any one suppose
they would have commended to God a nonentity?
This would be a shameless trifling with
sacred things.” But David, on one occasion (1
Sam. 26:24), prayed that his life might be much
set by, or be precious, in the eyes of the Lord.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>That which is precious in his sight, it seems
might very properly be commended to his keeping,
especially when passing, for his sake, out of
our immediate control. And in the very psalm
(31) in which he commits his spirit to God, he
does it in view of the fact that his enemies had
“devised to take away his <em>life</em>.” Verse 13.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a fact that the same or similar acts are
spoken of frequently as done in reference to the
life that are said to be done in reference to the
spirit. Can a person commit his spirit to God?
So he can commit to him the preservation of his
life. Thus David says, Ps. 64:1: “Preserve my
life.” What! Mr. Landis would exclaim, preserve
a nonentity? Jonah prayed (4:3), “O
Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me.”
Christ says, John 10:15: “I lay down my life
for the sheep;” and in John 13:38, he asks Peter,
“Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus our life is something that we can commit
to another for safe keeping; it can be taken away
from us; we can give it up, or lay it down. Is
it, therefore, a distinct entity, conscious in death?
If it is not, then equivalent expressions applied
to the spirit do not prove that to be conscious in
death and immortal; for they prove the same in
the one case as in the other; and whatever they
fail to prove in the one case, they fail to prove
also in the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the spirit, as is claimed, lives right along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>after death, just as conscious as before, and a
hundred-fold more active, capable, intelligent,
and free, where would be the propriety of committing
it to God in the hour of death, any more
than at any point during its earthly existence?
There would be none whatever. Entering upon
that permanent higher life, it would be much
more capable of caring for itself than in this
earthly condition. The expression bears upon
its very face evidence that those who used it desired
to commit something into the care of their
Maker which was about to pass out of their possession;
to commit something into his hands for
safe keeping until they should be brought back
from the state of unconsciousness and inactivity
into which they were then falling. And what
was that? It was what they were then losing,
namely, their life, their <em>pneuma</em>, which Robinson
defines as meaning, among other things, “The
principle of life residing in the breath, breathed
into man from God, and again returning to God.”
And when the life is thus given up to God by
his people, where is it? “Hid with Christ in
<a id='corr79.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='God. Col. 3:3. “And'>God.” Col. 3:3. And</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_79.23'><ins class='correction' title='God. Col. 3:3. “And'>God.” Col. 3:3. And</ins></a></span> when will the believer

shall appear.” Verse 4. Then Stephen will receive
from his Lord that which while dying he
besought him to receive. Then they who for
Christ’s sake have lost their life (not merely their
bodies while their life continued right on) will
have that life restored to them again.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER X. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE SPIRITS OF JUST MEN MADE PERFECT.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“But ye are come,” says Paul, “unto Mount Zion,
and unto the city of the living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem,
and to an innumerable company of angels, to
the general assembly and church of the firstborn which
are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and
to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the
mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of
sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of
Abel.” Heb. 12:22-24.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>With a great show of confidence, either pretended
or real, the advocates of man’s immortality
bring forward this text in proof of their
position. That portion of the forgoing quotation
upon which they hang their theory is the expression,
“the spirits of just men made perfect,”
which they take to be both a declaration and
proof thereof, that the spirits of men are released
by death, and thereupon are made perfect or glorified
in the presence of God in Heaven. A little
further examination of the language will, we
think, show that such an assertion is not made
in the text and that even such an inference cannot
justly be drawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>That Paul is here contrasting the blessings and
privileges enjoyed by believers under the gospel
dispensation with those possessed by the Jews
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>under the former dispensation, will probably not
be questioned on either side. Ye are not come
to the mount that might be touched [Mount
Sinai] and the sound of a trumpet, &amp;c., that is,
to that system of types and ceremonies instituted
through Moses at Sinai, of which an outward
priesthood were the ministers, and Old Jerusalem
the representative city; but ye are come to
Mount Zion, to the New Jerusalem, to Jesus, and
to his better sacrifice. These things to which
we are come are the superior blessings of the gospel,
over what was enjoyed under the former dispensation.
But where or how does the fact come
in, as one of these blessings, that man has a
spirit which is conscious in death, and is made
perfect by the dissolution of the body? It will
be seen that if this be a fact, it is brought in, at
best, only incidentally. There is no proof of it in
the expression, “spirits of just men made perfect,”
in itself considered; for they could be made perfect
at some future time, without supposing them
conscious from death to the resurrection. The
only proof that can here be found, then, lies in
the fact that we are said to have <em>come</em> to these
spirits. This is supposed to prove that they
must be spirits out of the body, and that they
must also be conscious. Then we inquire, How
do we come to the spirits of just men made perfect,
and what is meant by the expression?</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not difficult to determine how we come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>all the other objects mentioned by Paul in the
three verses quoted; but how we come to the
spirits of just men made perfect, according to
the popular view of that expression, is not so
clear. If we mistake not, the common view will
have to be modified, or the explanation remain
ungiven.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us see: “Ye are come [or, putting it in the
first person, since Paul brings these to view as
present blessings all through the gospel dispensation,
we are come] unto Mount Zion, and unto
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.”
That is, we in this dispensation no
longer look to Old Jerusalem as the center of our
worship, but we look above, to the New Jerusalem,
where the sanctuary and Priest of this dispensation
are. In this sense we are come to
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And to an innumerable company of angels.”
Angels are the assistants of our Lord in his work,
who now mediates for his people individually.
Dan. 7:10. They are sent forth to minister to
those who shall be heirs of salvation. Heb. 1:14.
They are therefore more intimately concerned
in the believer’s welfare in this dispensation
than in the old. We have thus come to
their presence and ministration.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the general assembly and church of the
firstborn which are written in Heaven.” That
is, we have now come to the time when believers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of whatever nationality, whose names are recorded
in the Lamb’s book of life in Heaven,
constitute a general assembly, or compose one
church. We do not now look to Jewish genealogies
to find the people of God, but we look to
the record in Heaven. And God now takes his
people into covenant relation with himself as individuals,
and not as a nation. Thus we are
come in this dispensation to the general assembly,
the church of the firstborn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And to God the Judge of all.” Directly,
through the mediation of his Son, we draw near
to God. Passing over for a time the expression
under discussion, the spirits of just men made
perfect, we read on:--</p>

<p class='c011'>“And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.”
We now come to Jesus, the real mediator,
instead of to the typical priesthood of the former
dispensation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh
better things than that of Abel.” That is, there
is now ministered for us the blood of Jesus, the
better sacrifice, which takes away from us sin in
fact, instead of the blood of beasts, which took it
away only in figure.</p>

<p class='c011'>It can readily be seen how we come to all these
things under this dispensation; how these are all
privileges and blessings under the gospel, beyond
what was enjoyed in the former dispensation.
But now, if the spirits of just men made perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>mean disembodied spirits in the popular sense,
how do we come to these as a gospel blessing?
This is what we would like to have our friends
tell us. In what respect is our relation to our
dead friends, the supposed spirits of the departed,
changed by the gospel? If there is any sense in
which we may be said to have come to these, we
would like to know it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But again, when do we come into closest contact
with a man’s spirit? Is it when that spirit
is disembodied, and has gone far away to dwell
in the presence of God, and is to have no more
to do forever with anything that is done under
the sun? Eccl. 9:6. Is it not rather when the
spirit of a man through the eyes of that man
looks upon us, through his mouth speaks to us,
and through his hands handles us? Outside the
hell-doomed hosts of spiritualists, will any one
say that we enjoy more intimate relations with a
spirit when it is out of the body than we do
while it is in the body? A consideration of this
point must convince any one that the idea of
<em>coming</em> to the spirits of just men made perfect
cannot possibly be applied to spirits out of the
body.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be noticed further that the text does
not speak of spirits made perfect, but of men
made perfect. The Greek (και πνεύμασι δικαίων τετελειωμένων)
shows that the participle, “made perfect,”
agrees with “the just,” or “just men,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>not with “spirits.” When, then, we inquire, are
men made perfect? There is a certain sense in
which they are made perfect in this life through
the justification of the blood of Christ, and sanctification
of his Spirit; and they are made perfect
in an absolute sense, as in Heb. 11:40, when
they experience the final glorification, and their
vile bodies are made like unto Christ’s most glorious
body. Phil. 3:21.</p>

<p class='c011'>If it is said that the text refers to this latter
perfection, then it is placed beyond the resurrection,
and affords no proof of a conscious disembodied
spirit. If it refers to the former, then it
applies to persons still in this state, and not in
death. To one or the other it must refer; and
apply it which way we may, it does not bring to
view a spirit conscious in death. Therefore it
fails entirely to prove the point in favor of which
our friends produce it.</p>

<p class='c011'>In harmony with the context, we apply it to
the present state, to men in this life, to a blessing
peculiar to the gospel, to the justification
and sanctification which the believer now enjoys
through Christ. And in this sense we see how
we come to it, as to all the other things mentioned
by Paul. We come to the enjoyment of
this blessing ourselves, and to communion and
fellowship with those who are also in possession
of it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Finally, to show that this not a view devised
to meet any exigency of our position, we will
bring to its support a name which with all will
have great weight, and with many will be final
authority. Dr. Adam Clarke, on this passage,
says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“In several parts of this epistle [to the Hebrews],
τελειος, the just man, signifies one who has a full knowledge
of the Christian system, who is justified and saved
by Christ Jesus; and τετελειωμενοι are the <em>adult Christians</em>,
who are opposed to the νεπιοι or babes in knowledge and
grace. See chap. 5:12-14; 8:11; Gal. 4:1-3. <em>The
spirits of just men made perfect</em>, or the <em>righteous perfect</em>,
are the full-grown Christians; those who are justified by
the blood and sanctified by the Spirit of Christ. Being
<em>come</em> to such implies that spiritual union which the disciples
of Christ have with each other, and which they possess
how far soever separate; for they are all joined in
one Spirit, Eph. 2:18; they are in the unity of the
Spirit, Eph. 4:3, 4; and of one soul, Acts 4:32. This
is a unity which was never possessed even by the Jews
themselves, in their best state; it is peculiar to real
Christianity; as to <em>nominal</em> Christianity, wars and desolations
between man and his fellows are quite consistent
with <em>its</em> spirit.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The reader is also referred to Dr. C.’s note at
the end of Heb. 12.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XI. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE SPIRITS IN PRISON.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just
for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put
to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit; by
which also he went and preached unto the spirits in
prison; which sometime were disobedient, when once the
longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while
the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls,
were saved by water.” 1 Pet. 3:18-20.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The advocates of natural immortality are not
long in finding their way to this passage. Here,
it is claimed, are spirits brought to view, out of
the body; for they were the spirits of the antediluvians:
and they were conscious and intelligent;
for they could listen to the preaching of Christ,
who, by his conscious spirit, while his body lay
in the grave, went and preached to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us see just what conclusions the popular
interpretation of this passage involves, that we
may test their claims by the Scriptures. 1. The
spirits were the spirits of wicked men; for they
were disobedient in the days of Noah, and perished
in the flood. 2. They were consequently
in their place of punishment, the place to which
popular theology assigns all such spirits immediately
on their passing from this state of existence.
3. The spirit of Christ went into hell to preach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>to them. These are the facts that are to be
cleared of improbabilities, and harmonized with
the Scriptures, before the passage can be made
available for the popular view.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the bare suggestion of so singular a transaction
as Christ’s going to preach to these spirits,
immediately gives rise to the query for what
purpose Christ should take pains to go down
into hell, to preach to damned spirits there; and
what message he could possibly bear to them.
The day of their probation was past; they could
not be helped by any gospel message; then why
preach to them? Would Christ go to taunt
them by describing before them blessings which
they could never receive, or raising in their bosoms
hopes of a release from damnation, which
he never designed to grant?</p>

<p class='c011'>These considerations fall like a mighty avalanche
across the way of the common interpretation.
The thought is felt to be almost an insuperable
objection, and many are the shifts devised
to get around it. One thinks that the word
preached does not necessarily mean to preach the
gospel, notwithstanding almost every instance of
the use of the word in the New Testament describes
the preaching of the gospel by Christ or
his apostles; but that Christ went there to announce
to them that his sufferings had been
accomplished, and the prophecies concerning
him fulfilled. But what object could there be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>in that? How would that affect their condition?
Was it to add poignancy to their pain by rendering
their misery doubly sure? And were
there not devils enough in hell to perform that
work, without making it necessary that Christ
should perform such a ghostly task, and that,
too, right between those points of time when he
laid down his life for our sins and was raised
again for our justification?</p>

<p class='c011'>Another thinks these were the spirits of such
as repented during the forty days’ rain of the
flood; that they were with the saved in Paradise,
a department of the under world where the
spirits of the good are kept (the elysium, in fact,
of ancient heathen mythology), but that they
“still felt uneasy on account of having perished
[that is, lost their bodies] under a divine judgment,”
and “were now assured by Jesus that
their repentance had been accepted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such resorts show the desperate extremities
to which the popular exposition of this passage
is driven.</p>

<p class='c011'>Others frankly acknowledge that they cannot
tell what, nor for what purpose, Christ preached
to the lost in hell. So Landis, p. 236. But he
says it makes no difference if we cannot tell what
he preached nor why he preached, since we have
the assurance that he did go there and preach.
Profound conclusion! Would it not be better,
since we have the assurance that he preached,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>to conclude that he preached at a time when
preaching could benefit them, rather than at a
time when we know that it could not profit
them, and there could be no occasion for it whatever?</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole issue thus turns on the question,
When was this work of preaching performed?
Some will say, “While they were in prison, and
that means the state of death, and shows that
the dead are conscious and can be preached to.”
Then, we reply, the dead also can be benefited
by preaching, and led to repentance; and the
doctrine of purgatory springs in full blossom
into our creed.</p>

<p class='c011'>But does the text affirm that the preaching
was done to these spirits while they were in
prison? May it not be that the preaching was
done at some previous time to persons who were,
when Peter wrote, in prison, or, if you please, in
a state of death? So it would be true that the
spirits were in prison when Peter makes mention
of them, and yet the preaching might have been
done to them at a former period, while they were
still in the flesh and could be benefited by it.
This is the view taken of the passage by Dr.
Clarke. He says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“<em>He went and preached</em>] By the ministry of Noah one
hundred and twenty years.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Thus he places Christ’s going and preaching
by his Spirit in the days of Noah, and not during
the time his body lay in the grave.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Again, he says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The word πνευμασι, <em>spirits</em>, is supposed to render this
view of the subject improbable, because this must mean
<em>disembodied</em> spirits; but this certainly does not follow;
for the <em>spirits of just men made perfect</em>, Heb. 12:23,
certainly means righteous men, and men <em>still in the
church militant</em>; and the Father of <em>spirits</em>, Heb. 12:9,
means men <em>still in the body</em>; and the God of the <em>spirits</em>
of all flesh, Num. 16:22, and 27:16, means <em>men</em>, <em>not</em> in a
disembodied state.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The preaching was certainly to the antediluvians.
But why should Christ single out that
class to preach to, about twenty-four hundred
years afterward, in hell? The whole idea is
forced, unnatural, and absurd. The preaching
that was given to them was through Noah, who,
by the power of the Holy Ghost (1 Pet. 1:12),
delivered to them the message of warning. Let
this be the preaching referred to, and all is harmonious
and clear; and this interpretation the
construction of the original demands; for the
word rendered in our version, “were disobedient,”
is simply the aorist participle; and the
dependent sentence, “when once the long-suffering
of God waited in the days of Noah,” limits
the verb “preached” rather than the participle.
The whole passage might be translated thus:
“In which also, having gone to the spirits in
prison, he preached to the then disobedient ones,
when once [or at the time when] the long-suffering
of God waited in the days of Noah.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>But how were they in prison? In the same
sense in which persons in error and darkness are
said to be in prison. Isa. 42:7: “To open the
blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the
prison house.” Also Isa. 61:1: “The Spirit of
the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord
hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto
the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the
broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,
and the opening of the prison to them
that are bound.” Christ himself declared, Luke
4:18-21, that this scripture was fulfilled in his
mission to those here on earth who sat in darkness
and error, and under the dominion of sin.
So the antediluvians were shut up under the
sentence of condemnation. Their days were
limited to a hundred and twenty years; and
their only way of escape from impending destruction
was through the preaching of Noah.</p>

<p class='c011'>So much with reference to the spirits to whom
the preaching was given. Now we affirm further
that Christ’s spirit did not go anywhere to preach
to anybody, while he lay in the grave. If Christ’s
spirit, the real being, the divine part, did survive
the death of the cross, then</p>

<p class='c011'>1. We have only a human offering for our
sacrifice; and the claim of the spiritualists is
true that the blood of Christ is no more than
that of any man.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>2. Then Christ did not pour out his soul unto
death and make it an offering for sin, as the
prophet declared that he would, Isa. 53:10, 12;
and his soul was not sorrowful even unto death,
as he himself affirmed. Matt. 26:38.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. The text says Christ was quickened by the
Spirit; and between his death and quickening
no action is affirmed of him; and hence any such
affirmation on the part of man is assumption.
There can be no doubt but the quickening here
brought to view was his resurrection. The
Greek word is a very strong one, ζωοποιέω, to impart
life, to make alive. He was put to death in
the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit. Landis,
p. 232, labors hard to turn this word from its
natural meaning and make it signify, not giving
life, but continuing alive. It is impossible to
regard this as anything less than unmitigated
sophistry. The verb is a regular active verb.
In the passive voice it expresses an action received.
Christ did not continue alive, but <em>was
made alive</em> by the Spirit. Then he was for a
time dead. How long? From the cross to the
resurrection. Rom. 1:4. So he says himself
in Rev. 1:18, I am he that liveth and was dead.
Yet men will stand up, and for the purpose of
sustaining a pet theory, rob the world’s Offering
of all its virtue, and nullify the whole plan of
salvation, by declaring that Christ never was
dead.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The word quicken is the same that is used in
Rom. 8:11: “But if the Spirit of Him that
raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you, He
that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also
quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
dwelleth in you.” God brought again our Lord
from the dead by the Holy Spirit; and by the
same Spirit are his followers to be raised up at
the last day. But that Christ went anywhere
in spirit, or did any action between his death
and quickening, is what the Scriptures nowhere
affirm, and no man has a right to claim.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Landis, p. 235, argues that this preaching
could not have been in the days of Noah, because
the events narrated took place this side the death
of Christ. Why did he not say this side the resurrection
of Christ? Oh! that would spoil it all.
But the record shows upon its very face that if
it refers to a time subsequent to Christ’s death,
it was also subsequent to his resurrection; for if
events are here stated in chronological order, the
resurrection of Christ as well as his death comes
before his preaching. Thus, 1. He was put to
death in the flesh. 2. Was quickened by the
Spirit, which was his resurrection, as no man
with any show of reason can dispute; and 3.
Went and preached to the spirits in prison. So
the preaching does not come in, on this ground,
till after Christ was made alive from the dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some people seem to treat the Scriptures as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>they were given to man that he might exercise
his inventive powers in trying to get around them.
But no inventive power that the human mind
has yet developed will enable a man, let him
plan, contrive, devise, and arrange, as he may,
to fix this preaching of Christ between his death
and resurrection. If he could fix it there, what
would it prove? The man of sin would rise up
and bless him from his papal throne, for proving
his darling purgatory. Such a position may do
for Mormons, Mohammedans, Pagans, and Papists;
but let no Protestant try to defend it, and not
hang his head for shame. Mr. Landis says that
“Mr. Dobney and the rest of the fraternity conveniently
forget that there is any such passage
[as 1 Pet. 3:19] in the word of God.” But we
cannot help thinking that it would have been
well for him, and saved a pitiful display of distorted
logic, if he had been prudent enough to
forget it too.</p>

<p class='c011'>THE WORD SPIRIT IN OTHER TEXTS.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are a few other texts which contain the
word spirit an explanation of which may be
properly introduced at this point:--</p>

<p class='c011'>Luke 24:39: “Behold my hands and my feet,
that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a
spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me
have.” These are the words of Christ as on one
occasion he met with his disciples after his resurrection;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and as he then possessed a spiritual
body which is given by the resurrection, it is
claimed that his words prove the existence of
spirits utterly disembodied in the popular sense.
But we inquire, What did the disciples suppose
they saw? Verse 37 states: “They supposed
they had seen a spirit;” and on this verse
Greenfield puts in the margin the word <em>phantasma</em>
instead of <em>pneuma</em>, and marks it as a
reading adopted by Griesbach. They supposed
they had seen a phantom, apparition, specter.
This exactly corresponds with their action when
on another occasion Christ came to them walking
on the sea, Matt. 14:26; Mark 6:49, and they
were affrighted and cried out, supposing it was a
spirit, where the Greek uses phantom in both
instances. The Bible nowhere countenances the
idea that phantoms or specters have any real
existence; but the imagination and superstition
of the human mind have ever been prolific in such
conceptions. The disciples were of course familiar
with the popular notions on this question;
and when the Saviour suddenly appeared in
their midst, coming in without lifting the latch,
or making any visible opening, as spiritual bodies
are able to do, their first idea was the superstitious
one of an apparition or specter, and they
were affrighted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now when Jesus, to allay their fears, told them
that a spirit had not flesh and bones as he had,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>he evidently used the word spirit in the sense of
the idea which they then had in their minds,
namely, that of a phantom; and though the
word <em>pneuma</em> is used, which in its very great
variety of meanings may be employed, perhaps, to
express such a conception, we are not to understand
that the word cannot be used to describe
bodies like that which Christ then possessed.
He was not such a spirit as they supposed; for
a <em>pneuma</em>, such as they then conceived of, in the
sense of a phantom, had not flesh and bones as
he had. Bloomfield, on verse 37, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“It may be added that our Lord meant not to countenance
those notions, but to show his hearers that, according
to their <em>own</em> notions of spirits, he was not one.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Acts 23:8: “For the Sadducees say that there
is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit, but
the Pharisees confess both.” Paul declared himself
in verse 6 to be a Pharisee; and in telling
what they believed, in verse 8, it is claimed that
Paul plainly ranged himself on the side of those
who believe in the separate conscious existence
of the spirit of man. But does this text say that
the Pharisees believed any such thing? Three
terms are used in expressing what the Sadducees
did not believe, “resurrection, angel, and spirit.”
But when the faith of the Pharisees is stated,
these three are reduced to <em>two</em>: “The Pharisees
confess <em>both</em>.” Both means only two, not three.
Now what two of the three terms before employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>unite to express one branch of the faith of the
Pharisees? The word angel could not be one;
for angels are a distinct race of beings from the
human family. Then we have left, resurrection
and spirit. The Pharisees believed in angels and
in the resurrection of the human race. Then all
the spirit they believed in, as pertaining to man,
according to this testimony, is what is connected
with the resurrection; and that, of course, is the
spiritual body with which we are then endowed.
“It is sown,” says this same apostle, “a natural
body, it is raised a <em>spiritual</em> body.” 1 Cor. 15:44.
That the term spirit is applied to those beings
which possess a spiritual body is evident
from Heb. 1:7, which reads, “Who maketh his
angels spirits.” Angels are personal beings, but
their bodies are spiritual bodies, invisible, under
ordinary circumstances, to mortal eyes. Hence
they are called spirits. So of God, John 4:24:
“God is a Spirit;” that is, a spiritual being; not
an impersonal one, as much in one place as another.</p>

<p class='c011'>1 Cor. 5:5: “To deliver such an one unto
Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the
spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
Jesus.” Although this text is quoted to prove
the separate conscious existence of a part of man
between death and the resurrection, the reader
cannot fail to notice that the time when the
spirit is saved is in the day of the Lord Jesus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>when the resurrection takes place. This text
proves nothing, therefore, respecting the condition
of the spirit previous to that time; and, so
far as our present purpose is concerned, we might
dismiss it with this remark; but a word or two
more may serve to free the text still further from
difficulty. What is meant by delivering the person
to Satan? and what is the destruction of the
flesh? Satan is the God of this world; and if
any man is a friend of the world, he is on the
side of Satan and an enemy of God. The church
is the body of Christ, and belongs to him. A
person committing the deeds spoken of in this
chapter must be separated from that body, and
given back to the world. He is thus delivered
unto Satan. This is for the destruction of the
flesh. The flesh is often used to mean the carnal
mind. Gal. 5:19-21. The spiritually-minded
man has crucified, or destroyed, the flesh. Now,
a person who desires eternal life, when he finds
himself set aside from the church, and placed
back in the world, the kingdom of Satan, on account
of his having the carnal mind, understands
that to gain eternal life he must then put away
the carnal mind, or crucify and destroy the flesh.
If he does this, he becomes spiritually minded,
joined again to the body of Christ, and the old
man, the flesh, being destroyed, he, as a spiritually-minded
man, will be saved in the day
of the Lord Jesus. Spirit we understand to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>be used in contrast with the flesh, the one denoting
a person in a carnal state, the other, in a
spiritual. To deal with a person as the apostle
here directs, set him aside from the church till he
sees, and repents of, his sins, is often the only
way to save him. In the day of the Lord Jesus,
a person is saved by having his body fashioned
like unto Christ’s glorious body, not destroyed.
Phil. 3:21. The destruction spoken of in the
text cannot therefore be the literal destruction of
the body in contrast with the disembodied spirit.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XII. <br /> <span class='fss'>DEPARTURE AND RETURN OF THE SOUL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We have now examined all those passages in
which the word spirit is used in such a manner
as to furnish what is claimed to be evidence of
its uninterrupted consciousness after the death of
the body. We have found them all easily explainable
in harmony with other positive and
literal declarations of the Scriptures that the
dead know not any thing, that when a man’s
breath goeth forth and he returneth to his earth,
his very thoughts perish, and that there is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>wisdom nor knowledge nor device in the grave
to which we go. And so far the unity of the
Bible system of truth on this point is unimpaired,
and the harmony of the testimony of the
Scriptures is maintained.</p>

<p class='c011'>We will now examine those scriptures in which
the term soul is supposed to be used in a manner
to favor the popular view. The first of these is
Gen. 35:18: “And it came to pass as her soul
was in departing (for she died), that she called
his name Benoni.” This is adduced as evidence
that the soul departs when the body dies, and
lives on in an active, conscious condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Luther Lee remarks on this passage:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Her body did not depart. Her brains did not depart.
There was nothing which departed which could consistently
be called her soul, only on the supposition that
there is in man an immaterial spirit which leaves the body
at death.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>We may offset this assertion of Luther Lee’s
with the following criticism from Prof. Bush:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“<em>As her soul was in departing.</em> Heb. <em>betzeth naphshah,
in the going out of her soul</em>, or <em>life</em>. Gr., ἐν τω ἀφιεναι ἀυτην
την ψυχην, <em>in her sending out her life</em>. The language
legitimately implies no more than the departing or ceasing
of the vital principle, whatever that be. In like manner
when the prophet Elijah stretched himself upon the
dead child, 1 Kings 17:21, and cried three times, saying,
‘O Lord my God, let this child’s soul come into him again,’
he merely prays for the return of his physical vitality.”--<cite>Note
on Gen. 35:18.</cite></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The Hebrew word here translated soul is <em>nephesh</em>,
rendered in the Septuagint by <em>psuche</em>;
and it is unnecessary to remind those who have
read the chapter on Soul and Spirit that these
words mean something besides body and brains.
They often signify that which can be said to
leave the body, as we shall presently see, rendering
entirely uncalled for the supposition of an
immaterial spirit which Mr. Lee makes such
haste to adopt.</p>

<p class='c011'>What then did depart, and what is the plain,
simple import of the declaration? We call the
reader’s attention again to the criticism of Parkhurst,
the lexicographer, on this passage:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“As a noun, <em>nephesh</em> hath been supposed to signify the
spiritual part of man, or what we commonly call his soul.
I must for myself confess that I can find no passage where
it hath undoubtedly this meaning. Gen. 35:18; 1 Kings
17:21, 22; Ps. 16:10, seem fairest for this signification.
But may not <em>nephesh</em>, in the three former passages, be
most properly rendered <em>breath</em>, and in the last, a breathing
or animal frame?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Thus, while Mr. Parkhurst admits that Gen.
35:18, is the fairest instance that can be found
where <em>nephesh</em> could be supposed to mean the
spiritual part of man, yet he will not so far hazard
his reputation, as a scholar and critic as to
give it that meaning in this or any other instance,
declaring that here it may most properly be rendered
“breath.” And this is in harmony with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>account of man’s creation, where it is seen that
the imparting of the breath of life is what made
Adam a living soul; and the loss of that breath,
of course, reduces man again to a state of death.</p>

<p class='c011'>1 Kings 17:21, 22: “And the Lord heard the
voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came
into him again, and he revived.” In the light of
the foregoing criticism on Gen. 35:18, this text
scarcely needs a passing remark. The same principle
of interpretation applies to this as to the
former. But one can hardly read such passages
as this without noticing how at variance they
read with the popular view. The child, as a
whole, is the object with which the text deals.
The child was dead. Something called the soul,
which the child is spoken of as having in possession,
had gone from him, which caused his death.
This element, not the child itself, but what belonged
to the child, as a living being, came into
him again, and <em>the child</em> revived.</p>

<p class='c011'>But according to the immaterialist view, this
passage should not so read at all. For that
makes the soul to be the child proper; and the
passage should read something like this: “And
the Lord heard the voice of Elijah, and the child
came and took possession of his body again, and
the body revived.” This is the popular view.
Mark the chasm between it and the Scripture
record.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Verse 17 tells what had left the child, and
what it was therefore necessary for the child to
recover before he could live again. “His sickness
was so sore,” says the record, “that there was
no <em>breath</em> left in him.” That was the trouble:
the breath of life was gone from the child. And
when Elijah comes to pray for his restoration, he
asks, in the most natural manner possible, that
the very thing that had left the child, and thereby
caused his death, might come into him again,
and cause him to live; and that was simply what
verse 17 states, the breath of life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus in neither of these passages do we find
any evidence of the existence of an immaterial,
immortal soul, which so confidently claims the
throne of honor in the temple of modern orthodoxy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIII. <br /> <span class='fss'>CAN THE SOUL BE KILLED?</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>Matt. 10:28: “And fear not them which kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear
him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Luke records the same sentiment in these
words:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“And I say unto you, my friends. Be not afraid of
them that kill the body, and after that have no more that
they can do. But I forewarn you whom ye shall fear:
Fear him, which, after he hath killed, hath power to cast
into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.” Luke 12:4, 5.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The estimate which immaterialists put upon
these texts is thus expressed by Mr. Landis, p.
181: “This text [Matt, 10:28] therefore must continue
to stand as the testimony of the Son of God
in favor of the soul’s immortality, and his solemn
condemnation of the soul-ruining errors of the
annihilation and Sadducean doctrine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We reply: Mr. L. evidently applies the argument
to a wrong issue; for whatever it may
teach concerning the intermediate state, it is most
positively against the doctrine of eternal misery,
and the consequent immortality of the soul. It
teaches that God can destroy the soul in hell; and
there is no force in our Lord’s warning unless we
understand it to affirm that he will thus destroy
the souls of the wicked. We never could with
any propriety be warned to fear a person because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>he could do that which he never designed to do,
and never would do. We are to fear the civil
magistrate to such a degree, at least, as not to
offend against the laws, because he has power
to put those laws into execution, and visit upon
us merited punishment; but our fear is to rest
not simply upon the fact that he has power to do
this, but upon the certainty that he will do it if
we are guilty of crime. Otherwise there could
be no cause of fear, and no ground for any
exhortation to fear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now we are to fear God, that is, fear to disobey
him, because he is able to destroy body and
soul in hell; and what is necessarily implied in
this? It is implied that he certainly <em>will</em> do this
in the cases of all those who do not fear him
enough to comply with his requirements. So
the text is a direct affirmation that the wicked
will be destroyed, both soul and body in hell.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next inquiry is, What is the meaning of
the word, destroy? We answer that, take the
word, soul, to mean what we will, the word,
destroy, here has the same meaning and the same
force as applied to the soul, that the word kill has
as applied to the body in the sentence before.
Whatever killing does to the body, destroying
does to the soul. Don’t fear men because
they cannot kill the soul as they kill the body;
but fear God because he can and will kill the
soul (if wicked) just as men kill the body.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>This is the only consistent interpretation of the
language. But all well understand what it does
to the body to kill it. It deprives it of all its
functions and powers of life and activity. It does
the same to the soul to destroy it, supposing the
soul to be what is popularly supposed. The word
here rendered destroy is ἀπολλύω (<em>appolluo</em>), and
is defined by Greenfield, “to destroy, to kill, to
put to death,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having seen that the text affirms in the most
positive manner the destruction of soul and body,
or the complete cessation of existence, for all
the wicked, in hell, we now inquire whether it
teaches a conscious existence for the soul in the
intermediate state? This must be, it is claimed,
because man cannot kill it. But the killing which
God inflicts, according to the popular view, is
torment in the flames of hell, and that commences
immediately upon the death of the body. Let us
then see what the Scriptures testify concerning
the receptacle of the dead and the place of punishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The word, hell, in our English version is from
three different Greek words. These words are
ἅδης (<em>hades</em>), γεέννα (<em>ge-enna</em>), and ταρταρόω (<em>tartaro-o</em>,
a verb signifying to thrust down to tartarus).
These all designate different places; and
the following full list of the instances of their
occurrence in the New Testament, will show
their use.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Tartaro-o</em> is used only in the following text:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“God spared not the angels that sinned, but <em>cast
them down to hell</em>.” 2 Pet. 2:4.</p>

<p class='c011'>From these references it will be seen that <em>hades</em>
is the place of the dead whether righteous or
wicked, from which they are brought only by a
resurrection. Rev. 20:13. On the contrary, Gehenna
is the place into which the wicked are to
be cast alive with all their members, to be destroyed
soul and body. These places, therefore,
are not to be confounded together.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the punishment against which the text
warns us, is not a punishment in <em>hades</em>, the
state or place of the dead, but in <em>Gehenna</em>, which
is not inflicted till after the resurrection. Therefore
we affirm that the text contains no evidence
whatever of the condition of man in death, but
passes over the entire period from the death of
the body to the resurrection. And this is further
evident from the record in Luke: “Be not
afraid of them that kill the body, and after that,
have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn
you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which
after he hath killed, hath power to cast into
hell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Luke does not use the term, soul, at all; yet he
expresses the same sentiment as Matthew. Man
can kill the body or destroy this present life;
but he can accomplish no destruction beyond that.
But God can not only kill the body, or destroy
the present life, but he can cast into Gehenna, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>destroy the life that we have beyond the resurrection.
These two things alone the text has in
view. And now when we remember that <em>psuche</em>,
the word here rendered, soul, often means life,
either the present or future, and is forty times in
the New Testament so rendered, the text is freed
from all difficulty. The word, kill, to be sure is
not such as would naturally be used in connection
with life; but the word, destroy, which is among
the definitions of the original word, <em>apokteino</em>, can
be appropriately used with life. Thus, fear not
them which kill the body, but are not able to
destroy the future life; but rather fear him who
is able to destroy the body and put an end to all
future life in hell. And it is worthy of notice
that the destruction in hell here threatened is
not inflicted upon a person without his body.
Nothing is said about God’s destroying the soul
alone; but it is at some point beyond this life,
when the person again has a body: which is not
till after the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another declaration from the lips of our Lord,
found in Matt. 16:25, 26, will throw some light
on our present subject: “For whosoever will save
his life shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his
life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man
profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose
his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange
for his soul?” The word soul should
here be rendered life. Dr. Clarke, on verse 26,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>says: “On what authority many here translate
the word <em>psuche</em> in the 25th verse, <em>life</em>, and
in this verse, <em>soul</em>, I know not, but am certain it
means life in both places.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But let us take the expressions, “soul” and
“to lose the soul,” in the popular sense, and what
should we have? Whosoever will save his
soul (to save the soul meaning to save it from
hell) shall lose it (that is shall go into hell torments):
but whosoever will lose his soul (suffer
eternal misery) for my sake, shall find it (shall be
saved in Heaven). This makes utter nonsense
of the passage, and so is a sufficient condemnation
of the view which makes such an interpretation
necessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>The passage simply refers to the present and
future life. Thus, whosoever will save his life,
that is, will deny Christ and his gospel for the
sake of avoiding persecution, or of preserving his
present life, he shall lose it in the world to come,
when God shall destroy both soul and body in
Gehenna; but he who shall lose his present life
if need be, for the sake of Christ and his cause,
shall find it in the world to come, when eternal
life is given to all the overcomers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here the life is spoken of as something which
can be lost and found again. Between the losing
and finding no one can claim that it maintains
a conscious existence. And what is meant by finding
it? Simply that God will bestow it upon us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>in the future beyond the resurrection. So what
is meant by the expression that man cannot kill
it? Simply the same thing, that God will, in the
resurrection, endow us with life again, a life
which is beyond the power of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>The life of all men is in the hands of God. The
body was formed of the dust, but the life was imparted
by God. Man, by sin, has made this present
life a temporary one. But through the plan
of salvation, by which the human race was placed
upon a second probation, after Adam’s fall, with
the privilege of still gaining eternal life, a future
life is decreed for all; for there shall be a resurrection
of the just and unjust. With the righteous,
this life will be eternal; for they have secured the
forgiveness of all their sins through Jesus Christ;
but with the wicked, it will soon end in the
second death; for they have thrown away their
golden privilege, and clung to their sins, the
wages of which is death. Man may hasten the
close of this present temporary life, may cut it
short by killing the body, for some years before
it would close in the natural course of events;
but that future life, which in the purpose of God
is as sure as his own throne, they cannot touch.</p>

<p class='c011'>The exhortation is to those who are striving to
serve God, and who thereby are liable to lose
their present lives at the hands of wicked men
for the truth’s sake. Fear them not, though with
the bloody arm of persecution they may deprive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>you of the present life; for the life which is to
come they cannot reach.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the warning is to the wicked that unless
they fear God more than men, and are governed
by his glory more than by worldly considerations,
he will bring their existence to an utter
end in the fire Gehenna.</p>

<p class='c011'>The text, therefore, so far from proving the existence
in man of an independent, death-surviving,
conscious entity called the immortal soul,
speaks only of the present and future life, and,
passing over the entire period between death and
the resurrection, then promises the righteous a
life which man cannot destroy, and affirms that
the wicked shall utterly cease to be in the second
death.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIV. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE SOULS UNDER THE ALTAR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In Rev. 6:9-11, is another instance where the
word, soul, is used in a manner which many take
to be proof that there is in man a separate entity,
conscious in death, and capable in a disembodied
state of performing all the acts, and exercising all
the emotions, which pertain to this life. The
verses referred to read:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under
the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>God, and for the testimony which they held. And they
cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy
and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on
them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were
given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them,
that they should rest yet for a little season, until their
fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be
killed as they were, should be fulfilled.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>On the hypothesis of the popular view, what
conclusions must we draw from this testimony?</p>

<p class='c011'>1. It is assumed that these souls were in
Heaven; then the altar under which John saw
them must have been the altar of incense, as
that is the only altar brought to view in Heaven.
Rev. 8:3. But the altar spoken of in the text
is evidently the altar of sacrifice upon which
they were slain. Therefore to represent them as
under the altar of incense, which was never used
for sacrifice, is both incongruous and unscriptural.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. We must conclude that they were in a state
of confinement, shut up under the altar--not a
condition we would naturally associate with the
perfection of heavenly bliss.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. Solomon says of the dead, that their love,
their hatred, and their envy, is now perished.
Eccl. 9:6. But that makes no difference; for
here are the souls of the holy martyrs still smarting
with resentment against their persecutors,
and calling for vengeance upon their devoted
heads. Is this altogether consistent? Would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>not the superlative bliss of Heaven swallow up
all resentment against those who had done them
this good though they meant them harm, and
lead them to bless rather than curse the hand
that had hastened them thither?</p>

<p class='c011'>But further, the same view which puts these
souls into Heaven, puts the souls of the wicked,
at the termination of this mortal life, into the
lake of fire, where they are racked with unutterable
and unceasing anguish, in full view of all
the heavenly host. In proof of this, the parable
of the rich man and Lazarus is strenuously urged.
But is it so? If it is not, then the popular exposition
of that parable must be abandoned. But
that supposed stronghold will not readily be surrendered,
so it is proper to look at the bearing it
has upon the case before us.</p>

<p class='c011'>According, then, to the orthodox view, the persecutors
of these souls were even then, or certainly
soon would be, enveloped in the flames of
hell, right before their eyes, every fiber of their
being quivering with a keenness of torture which
no language can express, and of which no mind
can adequately conceive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here they were, their agony full in view of
these souls of the martyrs, and their piercing
shrieks of infinite and hopeless woe ringing in
their ears; for the rich man and Abraham, you
know, could converse together across the gulf.
And was not the sight of all this woe enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>glut the most insatiate vengeance? Is there a
fiend in hell who could manifest the malevolence
of planning and praying for greater vengeance
than this? Yet these souls are represented, even
under these circumstances, as calling upon God
to avenge their blood on their persecutors, and
saying “How long?” as if chiding the tardy
movements of Providence, in commencing, or intensifying,
their torments. Such is the character
which the common view attributes to these holy
martyrs, and such the spirit with which it clothes
a system of religion the chief injunction of which
is to forgive, and the chief law of which is mercy.
Does it find indorsement in any breast in which
there remains a drop of even the milk of human
kindness?</p>

<p class='c011'>4. These souls pray that their <em>blood</em> may be
avenged--an article which the uncompounded,
invisible, and immaterial soul, as generally understood,
is not supposed to possess.</p>

<p class='c011'>These are some of the difficulties we meet,
some of the camels we have to swallow, in taking
down the popular view.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it is urged that these souls must be conscious;
for they cry to God. How easily our expositors
forget that language has any literal use,
when they wish it to be figurative, or that it is
ever used as a figure, when they wish it to be
literal. There is supposed to be such a figure of
speech as personification, in which, under certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>conditions, life, action, and intelligence, are attributed
to inanimate objects. Thus the blood
of Abel is said to have cried to God from the
ground. Gen. 4:9, 10. The stone cried out of
the wall, and the beam out of the timber
answered it. Hab. 2:11. The hire of the laborers,
kept back by fraud, cried; and the cry
entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
James 5:4. So these souls could cry, in the
same sense, and yet be no more conscious than
Abel’s blood, the stone, the beam, or the laborer’s
hire.</p>

<p class='c011'>So incongruous is the popular view that Albert
Barnes makes haste to set himself right on the
record as follows:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“We are not to suppose that this <em>literally</em> occurred, and
that John actually saw the souls of the martyrs beneath
the altar--for the whole representation is symbolical; nor
are we to suppose that the injured and the wronged in
Heaven actually pray for vengeance on those who wronged
them, or that the redeemed in Heaven will continue to
pray with reference to things on the earth; but it may
be fairly inferred from this that there will be <em>as real</em>
a remembrance of the wrongs of the persecuted, the injured,
and the oppressed, <em>as if</em> such a prayer was offered
there; and that the oppressor has as much to dread from
the divine vengeance, <em>as if</em> those whom he has injured
should cry in Heaven to the God who hears prayer, and
who takes vengeance.”--<cite>Notes on Rev. 6.</cite></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>But it is said that white robes were given
them; hence it is further urged that they must
be conscious. But this no more follows than it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>does from the fact that they cried. How was it?
They had gone down to the grave in the most
ignominious manner. Their lives had been misrepresented,
their reputations tarnished, their
names defamed, their motives maligned, and
their graves covered with shame and reproach,
as containing the dishonored dust of the most
vile and despicable characters. Thus the church
of Rome, which then molded the sentiments of
the principal nations of the earth, spared no
pains to make her victims an abhorring unto all
flesh.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the Reformation commences its work. It
soon begins to be seen that the Romish church is
the corrupt and disreputable party, and those
against whom it vents its rage are the good, the
pure, and the true. The work goes on among
the most enlightened nations, the reputation of
the church going down, and that of the martyrs
coming up, until the corruptions of the papal
abomination are fully exposed, and that huge
system of iniquity stands before the world in all
its naked deformity, while the martyrs are vindicated
from all the aspersions under which that
Antichristian church had sought to bury them.
Then it was seen that they had suffered, not for
being vile and criminal, but “for the word of God
and for the testimony which they held.” Then
their praises were sung, their virtues admired,
their fortitude applauded, their names honored,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and their memory cherished. And thus it is even
to this day. White robes have thus been given
unto every one of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole trouble on such passages as this we
conceive to arise from the theological definition
of the word soul: From that definition, one is
led to suppose that this text speaks of an immaterial,
invisible, immortal essence in man, which
soars into its coveted freedom on the death of its
hindrance and clog, the mortal body. No instance
of the occurrence of the word in the original
Hebrew or Greek will sustain such a definition.
It oftenest means life; and is not unfrequently
rendered, person. It applies to the dead
as well as to the living, as may be seen by reference
to Gen. 2:7, where the word, “living,” need
not have been expressed were life an inseparable
attribute of the soul; and to Num. 19:13, where
the Hebrew Concordance reads, “dead soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The reader is also referred to the previous
chapter on Soul and Spirit. From the definitions
there given, it is evident that the word soul
may mean, and the context requires that it here
should mean, simply the martyrs, those who had
been slain; the expression, “the souls of them,”
being used to designate the whole person. They
were represented to John as having been slain
upon the altar of papal sacrifice on this earth,
and lying dead beneath it. So Dr. Clarke, on
this passage, says, “The altar is upon earth, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>in Heaven.” They certainly were not alive when
John saw them under the fifth seal; for he again
brings to view the same company in almost the
same language, and assures us that the first time
they live after their martyrdom is at the resurrection
of the just. Rev. 20:4-6. Lying there,
victims of papal blood-thirstiness and oppression,
the great wrong, of which their sacrifice was the
evidence, called upon God for vengeance. They
cried, or their blood cried, even as Abel’s blood
cried to God from the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus another stronghold of the immortality
of the soul must be surrendered to a harmonious
interpretation, and the plain teaching, of the
word of God.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XV. <br /> <span class='fss'>GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The pleasing doctrine that man can never die,
though unfortunate in its parentage, is very tenacious
of its life. In treating this subject in
previous chapters, we have found that the record
of man’s creation brings to view no immortal
element as entering into his being; that the
Bible, in its use of the terms immortal and immortality,
never employs them to express an
attribute inherent in man’s nature; that no description
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of soul and spirit, and no signification
of the original words, will sustain the present
popular definition of these terms; that the soul
and spirit, though spoken of in the Bible, in the
aggregate, seventeen hundred times, are never
once said to be immortal or never-dying; and
that no text in which these words are supposed
to be employed in such a manner as to show that
they signify an ever-conscious, immortal principle,
can possibly be interpreted to sustain such a
doctrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet the dogma of natural immortality, very
reluctantly yields the ground. To a twentieth
proof text it will cling even the more tenaciously,
if the preceding nineteen are all swept away.
Besides the texts already noticed, there are a
few other passages behind which it seeks refuge;
and with alacrity we follow it into all its hiding-places,
confident that in no passage in all the
Bible can it find a shelter, but that into every
one which it claims as its own, it has entered,
not by right of possession, but as an intruder and
a usurper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Behind the obituaries of the patriarchs it
seeks to shield itself. It is claimed, for instance,
that the death of Abraham is recorded in such a
manner as to show that his conscious existence
did not cease with his earthly life. We might
justly insist on their going farther back and taking
the recorded close of the lives of the antediluvian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>patriarchs as the basis of their argument.
One of these, Enoch, was translated to Heaven
without seeing death; and all the others, according
to popular belief, went to Heaven just as
effectually, through death. But how different is
their record. Of Enoch it is said that he “was
not; for God took him;” while of the others it
is said, And they “died.” Surely these two
records do not mean the same thing, and Enoch,
whom God took, and who is consequently alive
in Heaven, must be, judging from the record, in
a different condition from those who died.</p>

<p class='c011'>But to return to the case of Abraham. The
record of his death reads: “Then Abraham gave
up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old
man and full of years, and was gathered to his
people.” On this verse, Landis, p. 130, thus remarks:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“What then is this <em>gathering</em>to the
body or the soul? It cannot refer to the body, for while
his body was buried in the cave of Macpelah, in Canaan,
his fathers were buried afar off; Terah, in Haran, in
Mesopotamia, and the rest of his ancestors far off in
Chaldea. Of course, then, this gathering relates not to
the body, but to the soul; he was gathered to the assembly
of the blessed, and thus entered his habitation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>To show how gratuitous, not to say preposterous,
is this conclusion, we raise a query on two
points: 1. Does the expression, “gathered to his
people,” denote that he went to dwell in conscious
intercourse with them? 2. Were his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>ancestors such righteous persons that they went
to Heaven when they died? In answering
these queries, the last shall be the first. It is a
significant fact that Abraham had to be <em>separated</em>
from his kindred and his <i>father’s house</i>, in order
that God might make him a special subject of
his providence. And in Josh. 24:2, we are
plainly told that his ancestors were idolaters;
for they served other gods. Such being their
character, death would send them, according to
the popular view, to the regions of the damned.
At the time, then, of Abraham’s death, they
were writhing amid the lurid waves of the lake
of fire. And when Abraham was gathered to
them, if it was in the sense which the theology
of our day teaches, he, too, was consigned to the
flames of hell! Oh! to what absurdities will
men suffer themselves to be led blindfold by a
petted theory. God had said to Abram, Gen.
15:15: “And thou shalt go to thy fathers in
peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.”
Was this the consoling promise that he should
go to hell in peace in a good old age? And is
the record of his death an assertion that he has
his place among the damned!? Yes! if the immaterialist
theory be correct. Children of Abraham,
arise! and with one mouth vindicate your
“righteous father” from the foul aspersion. Renounce
a theory as far from Heaven-born which
compels you thus to look upon the “father of the
faithful.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Does, then, the expression, “gathered to his
people,” mean his personal, conscious intercourse
with them? If man has an immortal soul which
lives in death, it does; and if it does, Abraham
is in hell. There is no way of avoiding this
conclusion, except by repudiating the idea that
man has such a soul, and denying his conscious
happiness or misery while in a state of death.</p>

<p class='c011'>But how, then, could he be gathered to his
people? Answer: He could go into the grave
into which they had gone, into the state of
death, in which they were held. Jacob said,
when mourning for Joseph whom he supposed
dead: “I will go down into the grave unto my
son mourning.” Not that he expected to go into
the same locality, or the same grave; for he did
not suppose that his son, being, as he then
thought, devoured by wild beasts, was in the
grave literally at all; but by the grave he evidently
meant a state of death; and as his son
had been violently deprived of life, he too would
go down mourning into the state of death; and
this he calls going unto his son. In Acts 13:36,
Paul, speaking of David, says that he “was <em>laid
unto his fathers</em>.” This all must acknowledge
to be the exact equivalent of being “gathered to
his people;” then the apostle goes on and adds,
“<em>and saw corruption</em>.” That which was laid
unto his fathers, or was gathered to his people,
saw corruption. Men may labor, if they choose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>to refer it to the immortal soul; but in that way
they do it a very doubtful favor; for the success
of their argument is the destruction of their
theory; and the soul is shown to be something
which is perishable and corruptible in its nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>The peaceful death of our father Abraham
furnishes no proof of an immortal soul in man,
and from his hallowed resting-place no arguments
for such a dogma can be drawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another text may properly be considered in
this connection:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>Ps. 90:10: “The days of our years are threescore
years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore
years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it
is soon cut off and we fly away.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>On the authority of this text it is claimed that
something flies away when our strength is cut
off in death; that that something is the immortal
soul, and that if it flies away, it is therefore conscious;
and if it thus survives the stroke of
death, it is therefore immortal: rather a numerous
array of conclusions, and rather weighty
ones, to be drawn from the three words, “we fly
away.” Let us look at David’s argument. The
reason given why our strength is labor and sorrow,
is because it is soon cut off and we fly away.
If, now, our flying away means the going away
of a conscious soul, into Heaven, for instance, if
we are righteous, his argument stands thus:
“Yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>is soon cut off, and <em>we go to Heaven</em>.” Singular
reasoning, this! But his argument is all consistent
if by flying away he means that we go into
the grave, where Solomon assures us that there
is no work, wisdom, knowledge, nor device. Let
us not abuse the psalmist’s reasoning.</p>

<p class='c011'>The text plainly tells us what flies away;
namely, <em>we</em> fly away. We is a personal pronoun
and includes the whole person. According to
Buck’s assertion that man is composed of two
<em>essential</em> elements, soul and body, the man is not
complete without them both; and the pronoun,
we, could not be used to express either of them
separately. The text does not intimate any
separation; it does not say that the soul flies
away, or the spirit flies away; but <em>we</em>, in our
undivided personality, fly away. To what place
does the body, an essential part of the we, fly?
To the grave, and there only.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is confirmed by Eccl. 9:3: “The heart
of the sons of men is full of evil; and madness is
in their hearts while they live, and after that
they go to the dead.” Had this text read, “And
after that they go away,” it would have been
exactly parallel to Ps. 90:10; for no essential
difference can be claimed between going and
flying. But here it is expressly told where we
go: we go to the <em>grave</em>. What is omitted in Ps.
90:10, is here supplied.</p>

<p class='c011'>We may also add that the Hebrew word <em>gooph</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>rendered “fly away,” signifies, according to Gesenius,
“First, to cover, spec. with wings, feathers,
as birds cover their young. Second, to fly, properly
of birds. Third, to cover over, wrap in
darkness. Fourth, to overcome with darkness,
to faint, to faint away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The idea is plainly this: Though our days be
fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and
sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we sink away,
go to the grave, and are wrapped in the darkness
of death. Viewed thus, David’s language is consistent,
and his reasoning harmonious; but his
language we pervert and his logic we destroy,
the moment we try to make his words prove the
separation from the body, of a conscious soul at
death.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVI. <br /> <span class='fss'>SAMUEL AND THE WOMAN OF ENDOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In all arguments for the continued life and
consciousness of the dead, 1 Sam. 28:3-20, usually
holds a conspicuous place. In examining
this scripture, we will look at (1) the narrative,
(2) the claim that is based upon it, (3) the character
of the actors in the incident, (4) the facts
to be considered, and (5) the conclusions to be
drawn.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>1. <em>The narrative.</em> Samuel was a prophet of
God in Israel from 1112 to 1058 before Christ.
Saul was king of Israel from 1096 to 1056 before
Christ. Samuel anointed Saul to his office as
king, and from time to time communicated instruction
to him from the Lord as his counselor
and adviser. At the time when the incident recorded
in 1 Sam. 28:3-20, occurred, Samuel was
dead. There was war between the Israelites and
the Philistines. The Philistines pressed hard
upon Israel. They gathered their forces together
in Shunem, and Saul, assembling all Israel to oppose
them, pitched in Gilboa. Dismayed at the
mighty array of the Philistine host, Saul’s heart
sunk within him, and he was sore afraid. In
anxiety and trembling, he cast about him for
help. He sought the Lord, but the Lord answered
him not. No dream was given, no token
by Urim appeared, no prophet had a word from
the mouth of the Lord to meet the circumstances
of his deep distress. He thought of his old-time
friend, the prophet Samuel, to whom he had so
often gone, and who had so often directed his
steps in times of doubt and danger. But Samuel
was dead, and how could he consult him?</p>

<p class='c011'>There was in the land a class of people who
claimed to have power to communicate with the
dead. This work, called necromancy (a “<em>pretended</em>
communication with the dead”--<cite>Webster</cite>),
had been strictly forbidden by the Lord,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Lev. 19:31; 20:27; Deut. 18:9-12, &amp;c. And
Saul in obedience to the command of the Lord,
Ex. 22:18, had cut off, so far as they could be
found, all persons of that class out of the land.
Yet a few, controlled wholly by the devil, still
practiced, with caution and secrecy, their hellish
orgies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether Saul had ever believed in the reality
of this work, or not, we are not informed. But
it is certain that in his present extremity, his
belief gave way to the pretensions of these necromancers,
and the evil thought took possession
of him that he could consult in this way with
the prophet Samuel. So he inquired for a woman
that had a familiar spirit, and was told of one at
Endor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Disguising himself, in order that the woman,
knowing Saul’s decree against witchcraft, might
not fear to communicate for him, and going secretly
by night, he sought the woman. The
woman being assured that no evil was intended
and no punishment should happen to her, asked
whom she should bring up. Saul answered,
Bring me up Samuel. And when she saw the
object which her conjuration had evoked, she
cried out with fear, and said to her royal guest,
Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
He told her to fear not, but tell what she saw.
She answered, An old man, covered with a mantle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“And Saul perceived,” says the narrative,
“that it was Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Samuel asked Saul why he had disquieted him
to bring him up; and Saul answered, that he
might make known what he should do; for the
Philistines made war upon him, and God was departed
from him, and he was sore distressed.
Samuel then asked him why he came to him
since God had departed from him, and had become
his enemy. Then he proceeded to tell him
that the kingdom was rent out of his hand because
he had failed to obey the Lord; that the
Philistines should triumph in the battle, and
that on the morrow he and his sons should die.
This was the finishing stroke to the already
breaking heart of Saul, and, utterly overwhelmed
with his calamities, he fell senseless to the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such are the essential facts brought to view
in the narrative. Let us now look at what is
claimed from them.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. <em>The claim.</em> This can be expressed in few
words. It is claimed that Samuel actually appeared
on this occasion, and that therefore the
dead are conscious, or that there is a spirit in
man that lives on in consciousness when the
body dies; and, therefore again, the soul is
immortal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The validity of this claim rests very much on
the question whether the transaction here recorded
was wrought by the power of God or by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the devil. If by God, then the representation
was a true one; if by the devil, we may look for
deception; for he commenced his work by becoming
the father of all the lies in the <a id='corr131.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='world.'>world,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_131.4'><ins class='correction' title='world.'>world,</ins></a></span>
and continues it by assiduously circulating <a id='corr131.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='them,'>them.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_131.5'><ins class='correction' title='them,'>them.</ins></a></span>
We will therefore consider,</p>

<p class='c011'>3. <em>The character of the actors.</em> These actors
were, first, the woman that had a familiar spirit;
and familiar spirits are spirits of devils. Compare
together Num. 25:1-3; Ps. 106:28; and
1 Cor. 10:20. This work of dealing with familiar
spirits, God had declared to be an abomination
to him, he had expressly forbidden it, and
sentenced to death all who practiced it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other chief actor in this scene was Saul.
And what was his condition at this time? He
had so long lived in violation of divine instruction
that God had departed from him, and answered
him no more by dreams, nor by Urim,
nor by prophets, which were the ways he had
himself appointed to communicate with his people.
Query: Would the Lord refuse to communicate
with him in ways of his own appointing,
and then come to him by means the use of
which he had expressly forbidden? We see
then that neither of the actors in this scene
were persons through whom, or for whom, we
should expect the Lord to work. We will therefore
notice further,</p>

<p class='c011'>4. <em>The facts to be considered.</em></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span><em>a.</em> The wonders wrought on this occasion were
all accomplished by the familiar spirit with whom
this woman consorted. There were two things
for this spirit to do: (1) Either to bring up in
reality the dead person that was called for, or
(2) to counterfeit the dead man so perfectly that
those who were conversing with the familiar
spirit would believe that they were conversing
with their dead friend.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>b.</em> That it was not Samuel, but the familiar
spirit personating Samuel, that appeared, is evident
from the fact that this supposed Samuel,
before holding any communication with Saul, put
the woman on her guard, telling her that her
guest was none other than Saul himself. This is
shown by the fact that the woman, as soon as she
saw him, cried out with fear, not because Samuel
really appeared contrary to her expectations, as
some have supposed; for she did not cry out,
“Samuel has come, indeed!” but because of what
the appearance told her, for she immediately
turned to Saul and said, “Why hast thou deceived
me? for thou art Saul.” This would not
be the work of the real Samuel, to put the woman
on her guard, to aid her in her unholy work of
incantation.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>c.</em> According to the claim based on this transaction,
it was Samuel’s immortal soul that appeared
on this occasion, but its appearance was,
according to the description of the woman, an old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>man covered with a mantle. Do immortal souls
go about in this way, in the form of old men covered
with mantles? This renders it still more
evident that it was the familiar spirit, imitating
Samuel as he appeared while here upon earth.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>d.</em> Saul did not see Samuel at all. But does
it not read that “Saul perceived that it was Samuel”?
Yes; but perceived how? Not by the
sight of his eyes, but from the woman’s description.
The words “saw,” as applied to the woman,
verse 12, and “perceive,” as applied to Saul, verse
14, are in the Septuagint different words. The
woman actually saw the appearance before her;
and here the word (<em>eido</em>) εἴδω is used, which
signifies, according to Liddell and Scott, “to see,
behold, look at;” but when it is said that Saul
perceived, the word is (<em>gignosco</em>) γιγνώσκω, which
signifies, according to the same authority, “to
know, perceive, gain knowledge of, observe, mark,
be aware of, see into, understand,” by an operation
of the mind. In harmony with this view,
is Saul’s language to the woman, “What sawest
<em>thou</em>?” and “What form is he of?” If any should
say that Saul might have seen all that the woman
saw if he had not been prostrate upon the ground,
it is sufficient to reply that it was not till after
he asked these questions that he “stooped with
his face to the ground, and bowed himself.”
Verse 14. If Samuel had actually been present,
Saul could have seen him as well as the woman.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span><em>e.</em> The appearance which the woman saw came
up out of the earth. Was that Samuel’s immortal
soul? Are these souls in the earth? We
supposed they were in the heavenly glories of
the world above.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>f.</em> Is it said that, as the form came up out of
the earth, Samuel had a resurrection. Then the
conscious-soul theory is abandoned. But if this
was a resurrection of Samuel, how could he come
up out of the ground here at Endor, near the sea
of Galilee, when he was buried in distant Ramah,
verse 3, near Jerusalem? And if the old man
was raised from the dead, what became of him?
Did he go through the pains of a second dissolution,
and enter the grave again? If so, well
might he complain to Saul for disquieting him
to bring him up.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>g.</em> This pretended Samuel told Saul that he
and his sons would be with him the following
day. Verse 19. If he was an immortal spirit in
glory, how could Saul, whom God had rejected
for his sins, go to be with him there?</p>

<p class='c011'><em>h.</em> Another sacred writer mentions this event
in Saul’s life, and assigns it as one of the two
reasons why he was given up by the Lord to die.
1 Chron. 10:13.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. <em>Conclusions.</em> What conclusions are inevitable
from the foregoing facts? It is first of all
evident that Samuel was not present on that occasion
either as an immortal spirit from the third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Heaven, or as one resurrected from the dead. For</p>

<p class='c011'><em>a.</em> It is not consistent to suppose that God,
having refused to answer Saul’s petitions in any
legitimate way, would have respect to them when
presented through this forbidden channel.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>b.</em> It is inconsistent to suppose that an immortal
soul from glory would come up out of the
earth, as did the form which the woman evoked
with her hellish incantations.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>c.</em> It is inconsistent to suppose that Samuel
was resurrected bodily here in Endor, when he
was buried in Ramah.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>d.</em> If he was raised, it must have been by God
or the devil. But the devil cannot raise the dead,
and it is evident that God would not, at least in
answer to these agencies, the use of which he had
forbidden under pain of death. God would not
thus raise up his servant to talk with Saul on
the devil’s own ground.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>e.</em> It is incredible that such a man as Samuel,
who held witchcraft as such a heinous sin, 1 Sam.
15:23, should first hold friendly converse with
this abandoned woman in the midst of her incantations,
and put her on her guard, before delivering
his message to Saul.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>f.</em> It is the boldest assumption to suppose that
any one, through this agency of the devil, would
have power to summon at will any immortal soul
from glory, or to raise any one from the dead, or
that this woman, through her hellish incantations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>would have power to behold the holy Samuel,
while Saul could see nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>But is it not said that the woman saw Samuel?
Yes; and here is the only seeming difficulty
in all the narrative. We find these four
expressions: “The woman saw Samuel;” verse
12; “And Samuel said to Saul;” verse 15; “Then
said Samuel;” verse 16; and, “because of the
words of Samuel.” Verse 20. And how could
it be so written, it is asked, if Samuel was not
there, and the woman did not see him, and he
did not say the things here recorded?</p>

<p class='c011'>Answer. This is easily explained by a very
common law of language. Consider the circumstances.
The woman stood ready to bring up
any one that might be called for. She believed,
of course, that they actually came, just as mediums
now-a-days believe the forms they see are
those of their departed friends. Samuel was
called for, and this mantled old man appeared.
She supposed it was Samuel; and Saul supposed
it was Samuel; and then, according to the general
law of the <em>language of appearance</em>, the narrative
proceeds <em>according to their supposition</em>.
When it says Samuel, it only means that form
that appeared, which they <em>supposed</em> to be Samuel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, the conclusion is apparent that this
was only a manifestation of ancient necromancy,
sorcery, witchcraft, or spiritualism; a wholesale
deception palmed off upon his dupes by the devil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>in disguise. Between the ancient and modern
there is this difference: Then he had to pretend
to bring up the dead from the ground; for the
people then believed that the dead were in the
lower regions of the earth: now he brings them
down from the upper spheres; for the prevailing
belief now is that those regions are populous
with the conscious spirits of the departed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let no one then appeal to the workings of the
witch of Endor to prove the immortality of the
soul, unless he is prepared to claim openly that
the Bible is a fiction, that ancient necromancy
was a divine practice, and that modern spiritualism
with all its godless blasphemies and its reeking
corruptions is the only reliable oracle of truth
and purity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVII. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE TRANSFIGURATION. MATT. 17:1-9.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>When our Lord was transfigured, on a high
mountain of Galilee, before Peter and James and
John, there appeared with him two other glorified
personages, talking with him. These, the
inspired narrator says, were Moses and Elias, as
the disciples understood them to be. Luke 9:30-33.</p>

<p class='c011'>With what pleasure does the immaterialist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>meet with an account of any manifestation or
action on the part of those who have long been
dead; it has so specious an appearance of sustaining
his views, or at least of furnishing him
ground for an argument; for, says he, the person
was dead, and this manifestation was by his
conscious spirit or immortal soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far as the case of Elias is concerned, as he
appeared at the transfiguration, it affords that
theory no benefit; for he, being translated, never
saw death, and so could appear in the body with
which he ascended. This is conceded by all;
and for this reason his case is never put in as a
witness on this question, except by those who
are so unfamiliar with the record as to suppose
that he, too, once died, and here appeared as a
disembodied spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>But with Moses the case is different; for we
have in the Bible a plain account of his death
and burial; yet here he appeared on the mount,
alive, active, and conscious; for he talked with
Christ. And so with an air of triumph, perhaps
sincere, Landis asks (p. 181), “What then have
our opponents to say to this argument? for they
must meet it or renounce their theory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Were we Sadducees, denying the resurrection,
and any future life beyond the grave, this case
would lie as an insuperable barrier across our
pathway; but so long as the doctrine of the resurrection
of the dead is taught in the Bible, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>incident is not necessarily against those who
deny the existence of any such thing as a conscious,
disembodied human spirit, since the presence
of Moses on the mount can be accounted
for otherwise than through such a medium.</p>

<p class='c011'>This scene was either a representation, made
to pass before the minds of the disciples, or it
was a reality as it appeared. The view that it
was merely a representation receives some countenance
from the fact that it is called a vision.
“Tell the vision to no man,” said Christ; and,
while the word, vision, is sometimes applied to
real appearances, as in Luke 24:43, it also is
taken to represent things that do not yet exist,
as in John’s vision of the new heavens and new
earth. Again, Luke says that they (Moses and
Elias) “appeared in glory.” Our Lord himself
has not yet attained unto the full measure of
glory that is to result to him from his work of
redemption, 1 Pet. 1:11; Isa. 53:11; and it
may well be doubted likewise if any of his followers
have reached their full state of glory. If,
then, the expression quoted from Luke refers to
the future perfected glory of the redeemed, we
have another evidence that this was only a representation,
like John’s visions of future scenes
of bliss, and not then a reality. But, if this was
only a vision, no argument can be drawn from it
for the intermediate existence of the soul; for, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>that case, Moses and Elias need not have been
even immaterially present.</p>

<p class='c011'>But let us consider it a reality. Then the
presence of Moses can be accounted for by supposing
his resurrection from the dead. Against
this hypothesis our opponents have nothing to
offer but their own assertions; and they seem
determined to make up in the amount of this
commodity what it lacks in conclusiveness.
Thus Landis says, “Moses had died and was
buried, and as his body had never been raised
from the dead, he of course appeared as a disembodied
spirit.” And Luther Lee says, “So
far as Moses is concerned, the argument is conclusive.”
But against these authorities, we bring
forth another on the other side, as weighty, at
least, as both of them together. Dr. Adam
Clarke says, on the same passage, “The body of
Moses was probably raised again, as a pledge of
the resurrection.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before presenting an argument to show that
Moses was raised, let us look at one consideration
which proves beyond a peradventure that what
appeared on the mount was not Moses’ disembodied
spirit. It will be admitted by all that
the transfiguration was for the purpose of presenting
in miniature the future kingdom of God,
the kingdom of glory. Andrews (Life of our
Lord, p. 321) says: “The Lord was pleased to
show certain of the apostles, by a momentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>transfiguration of his person, the supernatural
character of his kingdom, and into what new
and higher conditions of being both he and they
must be brought ere it could come....
They saw in the ineffable glory of his person,
and the brightness around them, a foreshadowing
of the kingdom of God as it should come with
power; and were for a moment ’eye-witnesses of
his majesty.’ 2 Pet. 1:16.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Who are to be the subjects in this heavenly
kingdom? Ans. Those who are translated at
Christ’s coming, and the righteous dead who are
raised from their graves at that time. Will there
be any disembodied spirits there? None; for
the theory is that at the resurrection, which
precedes the setting up of this kingdom, the
disembodied spirits again take possession of their
reanimated bodies. Of this kingdom, the transfiguration
was a representation. There was
Christ, the glorified king; there was Elias, the
representative of those who are to be translated;
and there was Moses; but, if it was simply his
disembodied soul, then there was a representation
of something that will not exist in the kingdom
of God at all; and the representation was an
imperfect one, and so an utter failure. But if
Moses was there in a body raised from the dead,
then the scene was harmonious and consistent,
he representing, as Dr. Clarke supposes, the
righteous dead who are to be raised, and Elias,
the living who are to be translated.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>The question now turns upon the resurrection
of Moses from the dead; and if scriptural evidence
can be shown that Moses was thus raised,
this passage immediately changes sides in this
controversy. That Moses was raised, we think
is to be necessarily inferred from Jude 9: “Yet
Michael the archangel, when contending with the
devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, durst
not bring against him a railing accusation, but
said, The Lord rebuke thee.” It will be noticed
that this dispute was about the <em>body</em> of Moses.
Michael (Christ, John 5:27-29; 1 Thess. 4:16)
and the devil, each claimed, it appears, the right
to do something with his body.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some have endeavored to reconcile Jude’s
testimony with the non-resurrection of Moses, by
claiming that the devil wished to make known
to the children of Israel the place of Moses’
burial, in order to lead them into idolatry; and
that the contention between him and Michael
had reference to this. But such a conjecture
cannot be entertained, as in this case the contention
would have been about the <em>grave</em> of Moses,
rather than about his <em>body</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this dispute did have reference solely to
the body of Moses. Then we inquire further
what the devil has to do with the bodies of men.
He is said to have the power of death; hence
the grave is his dominion, and whoever enters
there he claims as his lawful prey. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>other hand, Christ is the Life-giver, whose prerogative
it is to bring men out from under the
power of death. The most natural conclusion,
therefore, is, that the dispute took place on this
very point; that it had reference to the bringing
back to life of that dead body, which the devil
would naturally wish to keep, and claim the
right to keep, in his own power. But Christ
rebuked the adversary, and rescued his victim
from his grasp. This is the <em>necessary</em> inference
from this passage, and, as such, is entitled to
weight in this argument.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief objection to this view, is this: If
Moses was raised so many years before the resurrection
of Christ, how can Christ be called the
first-fruits of them that slept, as in 1 Cor. 15:20,
23? how can he be said to be the first that
should rise from the dead, as in Acts 26:23?
or be called the first-begotten, and first-begotten
of the dead, as in Heb. 1:6, and Rev. 1:5? or
the first-born among many brethren, the first-born
of every creature, and the first-born from
the dead, as in Rom. 8:29, and Col. 1:15, 18?</p>

<p class='c011'>In answering these queries, we first call attention
to an important fact: Several individuals,
of whom we have explicit account, were raised
to life before the resurrection of Christ. The
following cases may be cited: (1) The widow’s
son, 1 Kings 17, (2) the son of the Shunammite,
2 Kings 4, (3) the son of the widow of Nain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Luke 7:14, (4) the ruler’s daughter, Luke 8:40,
55, and (5) the resurrection of Lazarus.</p>

<p class='c011'>These instances cannot be disposed of by making
a distinction between a resurrection to mortality
and one to immortality; for where does the
Bible make any such distinction? or where does
it give even an intimation of anything of the
kind? Christ, in sending word to John of the
results of his work, told the disciples to tell him,
among other things, that <em>the dead</em> were <em>raised
up</em>. And when the wicked are restored to life,
it is called a <em>resurrection</em>, no less so than the
restoration of the righteous. See John 5:29;
Acts 24:15; Rev. 20:5. But the wicked are
not raised to immortality; therefore in the matter
of being raised from the dead, the Bible recognizes
no distinction on account of the different
conditions to which the different classes are
raised. Hence the cases referred to above were
resurrections from the dead just as really as
though they had been raised to immortality;
and the distinction which some attempt to make
is thus shown to be wholly gratuitous, and is
excluded from the controversy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The objection now lies just as much against
the cases of those of whose resurrection we have
the most explicit account, as against that of
Moses; and the question next to be met is, Can
those passages which declare that a number of
the dead were raised before the resurrection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Christ, and those which speak of Christ as the
first to be raised, be shown to be free from contradiction?</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be noticed that the objection, so far as
the words, first-fruits, first-begotten, and first-born,
are concerned, rests wholly upon the supposition
that these words denote exclusively
priority in time. It instantly vanishes before
the fact that these words are not confined to this
meaning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Christ is called the first-fruits in 1 Cor. 15,
solely in reference to his being the antitype of
the wave-sheaf, and in contrast with the great
harvest that will take place at his second coming.
This word is used in different senses, as we learn
from Jas. 1:18, and Rev. 14:4, where it cannot
have reference to antecedence in time. This is
all that need be said on this word.</p>

<p class='c011'>The word rendered first-begotten and first-born
is πρωτοτοκος (<em>prototokos</em>). This word is
defined by Robinson thus: “Properly the first-born
of father or mother;” and, as the first-born
was entitled to certain prerogatives and privileges
over the rest of the family, the word takes another
meaning, namely, “first-born, the same as
<em>the first</em>, <em>the chief</em>, one highly distinguished and
pre-eminent. So of Christ, the beloved Son of
God. Col. 1:15.” Greenfield’s definition is
similar. This word is used in the same sense in
the Septuagint. In Ex. 4:22, Israel is called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the first-born; and in Jer. 31:9, Ephraim is
called the first-born; but, in point of time, Esau
was before Israel, and Manasseh before Ephraim.
Their being called the first-born must therefore
be owing to the rank, dignity, and station, to
which they had attained.</p>

<p class='c011'>And hence the conclusion is not without
foundation that these words, when applied to
Christ, denote the pre-eminent rank and station
which he holds in the great work, rather than
the order of time in which his resurrection occurred,
a point to which no importance whatever
can be attached. All hinges upon Christ, and
all is accomplished by his power, and by virtue
of his resurrection. He stands out foremost and
pre-eminent in all these displays, whether they
take place before or after his advent to this
world.</p>

<p class='c011'>The expression in Acts 27:23, presents apparently
the greatest difficulty of any. The verse
reads: “That Christ should suffer, and that he
should be the first that should rise from the
dead, and should show light unto the people and
to the Gentiles.” As it stands in our common
version it is difficult to reconcile this statement
with the fact that a number were raised from
the dead previous to the resurrection of Christ
as already noticed, and we are led to wonder
why Paul, knowing of all these cases, should
make such a statement. But, if we mistake not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the original presents a different idea. In Greenfield’s
Testament, the text stands thus:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'>Εἰ παθητὸς ὁ Χριστὸς, εἰ πρῶτος ἐξ ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν φῶς
μέλλει καταγγέλλειν τω λαῷ καὶ τοῖς ἔθνεσι.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>We call the attention of those familiar with
the Greek to this passage, and submit that it can
be properly rendered as follows: “That Christ
was to suffer, [and] that first from the resurrection
of the dead he was to show light to the
people and to the Gentiles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bloomfield, in his note on this verse, says that
the words “may be rendered, either ‘after the
resurrection from the dead,’ or ‘by the resurrection;’
but the latter is preferable.” And Wakefield
translates it thus: “That the Christ would
suffer death, and would be the first to proclaim
salvation to this people and to the Gentiles by a
resurrection from the dead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This is in accordance with what the same
apostle declared to Timothy (1 Tim. 1:10), that
Christ brought life and immortality to light
through the gospel. And viewed in this light,
the text is freed from all difficulty. It simply
teaches that Christ would be the first to demonstrate
before the people, by a resurrection from
the dead, future life and immortality for the
redeemed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The resurrection of Lazarus, and other similar
cases, though they might show that the power of
death could be so far broken as to give us a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>lease of mortal life, shed no light on our existence
beyond this mortal state. And the resurrection
of Moses, supposing him to have been raised,
was not a public demonstration designed to show
the people the path to a future life. So far as
we have any account, no one knew that he had
been raised till he appeared upon the mount of
transfiguration. Christ was the first one to show
to the world, by his rising from the dead, the
great light of life and immortality beyond the
grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the last seeming objection against the
idea that Moses had a resurrection is taken away;
while in its favor we have his appearance on the
mount, and the language of Jude, which can be
explained on no other ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us then take that view which a consistent
regard for scriptural harmony demands, though
another supposed strong column on which rests
the dogma of the immortality of the soul, goes
down before it with a crash to the very dust.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVIII. <br /> <span class='fss'>DID CHRIST TEACH THAT THE DEAD ARE ALIVE?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Yes, says the immaterialist, for he taught that
God, who declares himself to be the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, is not the God of the dead,
but of the living; therefore, Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, are living; but they are living as immaterial,
disembodied immortal spirits; for their bodies
are in the grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>The occasion on which these words were spoken
is described in Matt. 22:23-32. To understand
the words of Christ, we must understand fully
the point at issue, and what his words were designed
to prove; and to do this, we must look
carefully at the narrative:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say
that there is no resurrection, and asked him, saying, Master,
Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his
brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his
brother. Now there were with us seven brethren; and
the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having
no issue, left his wife unto his brother: likewise the
second also, and the third, unto the seventh. And last
of all the woman died also. Therefore in the resurrection,
whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing
the Scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the
resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,
but are as the angels of God in Heaven. But as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the
living.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>What, then, was the point at issue between
Christ and the Sadducees? See verse 23: “The
same day, came to him the Sadducees, which <em>say
there is no resurrection</em>, and asked him,” &amp;c.
The Sadducees professed to believe the writings
of Moses, but denied the resurrection. Christ
also believed the writings of Moses, but <em>taught</em>
the resurrection. Here, then, was a fair issue
between them. They hear him teaching the resurrection;
and to object their faith to his, they
refer to the law of Moses concerning marriage,
and then state a familiar fact; viz., that seven
brothers, one after another, all had one woman,
and all died. Now arises a problem very difficult
to their minds, no doubt. How will this
matter be arranged in the resurrection which you
teach? Whose wife shall she be in the resurrection?
Let it be noticed that the controversy
between Christ and the Sadducees had no respect
whatever to an intermediate state, nor does their
query or Christ’s answer have any reference to
such a state. They do not inquire whose wife
she is now, or which of the men’s immortal souls
claims her immortal soul in the spirit world; but,
Whose wife <em>shall she be</em> in the resurrection (a
future event)? Christ tells them that they err,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of
God. And then, to defend himself and condemn
them out of their own mouth, he proceeds to
prove--what? a conscious intermediate state?
No; but <em>the resurrection</em>, from the writings of
Moses. “But as touching the resurrection from
the dead,” says he [as touching the dead that
they rise, says Mark; and that the dead are
raised, says Luke], “have ye not read that which
was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead,
but of the living.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us now show that this quotation did prove
the resurrection, and our argument on this passage
is closed. That, Moses by this language, did
teach the resurrection of the dead, we think is
easily evident. Thus, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
were dead; but God is not the God of the dead
(or those who are irrecoverably and eternally dead,
as the Sadducees believed them to be), but he <em>is</em>
the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. What,
therefore, shall we logically and scripturally conclude
from this fact? Why, simply that they
shall live again, or have a resurrection from the
dead. In this view of the subject, Christ reasoned
well, proved the point he aimed to prove,
confounded the Sadducees, and gained the applause
of the Pharisees, who believed in the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>But grant for a moment that the language
means what is popularly claimed for it, and what
becomes of Christ’s reputation as a reasoner, and
a teacher of wisdom sent from God? He set out
to prove the resurrection; but when he closes
his argument, lo, wonderful to tell! he has proved
that all men are alive, and, therefore, there is no
<em>need</em> of a resurrection! He neither meets the
query of the Sadducees, nor defends himself, but
quite the reverse. Believe that our Lord would
reason thus, ye who can!</p>

<p class='c011'>If any should admit that a resurrection is
proved by the language, but claim from it that
such resurrection takes place at death, a theory
not uncommon at the present time, we reply that
they thereby abandon the conscious-state theory,
and affirm the existence of those who have died,
on another ground, viz., a resurrection. But,
further, this is equally foreign from what Christ
set out to prove; for he had reference to an event
which was then future to the seven brethren and
the woman that died. They asked him, saying,
“In the resurrection, therefore, when they <em>shall
rise</em>, whose wife <em>shall she be</em> of them,” &amp;c. And
Jesus answered and said, “When they <em>shall rise</em>
from the dead, they neither marry nor are given
in marriage, but are as the angels in Heaven.”
Mark 12:23-25. Again, in Luke’s account, Jesus
says, “But they which <em>shall be</em> accounted
worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>from the dead, neither marry nor are given in
marriage.” Luke 20:35. Thus we see that a
future event is everywhere referred to, and if he
in reality proved that an event had already
taken place, which he designed to show would
take place in the future, it speaks no better for
his reasoning or his wisdom than the former supposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Why God calls himself the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, though they are yet dead, we
learn from Heb. 11:16. It is not because they
are now alive, but because in God’s purpose who
speaks of things that are not, as though they were,
they are to live, and “he <em>hath prepared</em> for them
a city.” <a id='corr153.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Wherefore'>“Wherefore</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_153.14'><ins class='correction' title='Wherefore'>“Wherefore</ins></a></span>, God is not ashamed to be
called their God; for he hath prepared for them
a city,” into possession of which they will of course
come in the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>In view of these facts, our friends should be
careful lest they expose themselves to the rebuke
Christ gave to the Sadducees: “Ye do err, not
knowing the Scriptures;” for this instance, like
all others, when properly understood, so far from
sustaining their position, becomes an irrefragable
evidence of the resurrection of the dead, and a
future life, but affirms nothing whatever for consciousness
in death.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIX. <br /> <span class='fss'>MOSES AND THE PROPHETS ON THE PLACE AND CONDITION OF THE DEAD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The hoary fable that every man has in his
own nature an immaterial, ever-conscious, never-dying
principle, vaulting from the gloomy regions
of heathen mythology over into the precincts
of Christianity, and claiming the positive
authority of Christ and his apostles, instead of
the uncertain speculations of Socrates and Plato,
conceives that it finds a secure intrenchment in
Luke 16:19-31, or the record concerning the rich
man and Lazarus.</p>

<p class='c011'>Into this record, as into the strongest of strongholds,
it enters with every demonstration of confidence;
and from its supposed impregnable walls,
it hurls mockery and defiance against all opposing
views, as the infatuated subjects of Belshazzar
defied the soldiers of Cyrus from the walls of
Babylon.</p>

<p class='c011'>We venture to approach, at least to reconnoiter.
We venture further, from the record itself, even
to lay siege to it, and dig a trench about it, which,
if we mistake not, will soon effectually reduce it,
and all the arguments for immortality it is supposed
to contain.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first fact to which we call the attention of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the reader is that Christ, as the result of this
narrative or parable, or whatever it may be, refers
us to Moses and the prophets for light and
information respecting the place and condition of
the dead. In the record, the rich man is represented
as requesting that Lazarus might be sent
to his brethren on earth, lest they should come
into the same place of torment. How would he
prevent them? By carrying back to them information
respecting the state that follows this
life; by telling how it fared with the covetous
rich man who had enjoyed his good things in
this life, and inducing them to live such a life here
as to avoid the condition into which he had fallen.</p>

<p class='c011'>And what was Abraham’s answer? “They
have Moses and the prophets.... If they
hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will
they be persuaded though one rose from the
dead.” That is to say, Moses and the prophets
had given them just as positive information respecting
the condition into which man passes
from this life, as could be given them by one who
should repass the portals of the grave and rise
from the dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>The significance of this declaration should not
be overlooked. It throws us right back upon the
records of Moses and the prophets for information
upon that subject respecting which the incident
here related is claimed to be full and sufficient
testimony.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>We therefore inquire what Moses and the
prophets have taught us respecting the place
where the scene here depicted is represented to
have taken place. What place was this? Answer,
<em>Hades</em>; for this is the word from which hell is
translated in verse 23. In hell, <em>hades</em>, the rich man
lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham and Lazarus
afar off, though still within sight and speaking
distance. The New Testament was written in
Greek, while Moses and the prophets wrote in
Hebrew. What is the Hebrew word answering
to the Greek <em>hades</em>? Answer, <em>Sheol</em>. These are
the equivalent terms in the two languages. All
that a Hebrew writer meant by <em>sheol</em>, a Greek
writer meant by <em>hades</em>, and <em>vice versa</em>. The
question, then, is simply this: What have Moses
and the prophets taught us respecting <em>sheol</em>, and
the condition of those who enter therein?</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Meaning of hades and sheol.</em> These words
denote the common receptacle of the dead, both
righteous and wicked. The righteous dead are
there; for at the resurrection they raise the victorious
shout, “O Death, where is thy sting? O
Grave [Gr. <em>hades</em>], where is thy victory?” 1 Cor.
15:55. And the wicked dead are there; for at
the resurrection to damnation it is said that
death and hell [Gr. <em>hades</em>] deliver them up.
Rev. 20:13. That the <em>hades</em> of the New Testament
is the <em>sheol</em> of the Old, Ps. 16, and Acts 2:27,
bear testimony. Thus Ps. 16:10, says, “Thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>wilt not leave my soul in hell [Heb. <em>sheol</em>];” and
the New Testament, as above, makes a direct
quotation of this passage by saying, “Thou wilt
not leave my soul in <em>hades</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Use of the word sheol.</em> This word occurs in
the Old Testament sixty-five times. It is rendered
hell and grave each thirty-one times, and
pit three times. With our Lord’s special indorsement
of what is there written concerning
it, we may look with interest at the facts
brought out by the testimony of Moses and the
prophets.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>All alike go there.</em> Thus Jacob says, “I will
go down into <em>sheol</em> [to use the original word in
place of the English rendering], unto my son
mourning.” Gen. 37:35. Korah and his company
went down into <em>sheol</em>. Num. 16:30, 33.
All mankind go there. Ps. 89:48.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>What goes into sheol.</em> <em>Sheol</em> receives the
whole man bodily at death. Jacob expected to
go down with his gray hairs to <em>sheol</em>. Korah,
Dathan, and Abiram, went into <em>sheol</em> bodily.
The soul of the Saviour left <em>sheol</em> at his resurrection.
Ps. 16:10; Acts 2:27, 31. David,
when restored from dangerous sickness, testified
that his soul was saved from going into <em>sheol</em>.
Ps. 30:2, 3.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>The duration of its dominion.</em> Those who
go down into <em>sheol</em> must remain there till their
resurrection. At the second coming of Christ,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>all the righteous are delivered from <em>sheol</em>. All
the living wicked are then turned into <em>sheol</em>, and
for one thousand years it holds them in its dread
embrace. Then it gives them up, and judgment
is executed upon them. Rev. 20:11-15.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Location of sheol.</em> It is in the earth beneath.
It embraces the interior of the earth as the region
of the dead, and the place of every grave.
Eze. 32:18-32. It is always spoken of as beneath,
in the interior of the earth, or in the nether
parts of the earth. See Num. 16:30, 33;
Isa. 5:14; 14:9-20; Eze. 31:15-18; 32:18-32.
Referring to the fires now preying upon the interior
parts of the earth, and which shall at last
cause the earth to melt with fervent heat, the
Lord, through Moses, says: “For a fire is kindled
in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest
<em>sheol</em>, and shall consume the earth with her increase,
and set on fire the foundation of the
mountains.” Deut. 32:22. Jonah went down
into <em>sheol</em> when he descended into the depths of
the waters, where none but dead men had ever
been. Jonah 1:2.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Condition of the righteous in sheol.</em> They do
not praise the Lord there. David so testifies:
“In death there is no remembrance of thee; in
<em>sheol</em> who shall give thee thanks?” Ps. 6:5.
Hezekiah uttered the same great truth, when he
was delivered from death in answer to prayer:
“I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>to the gates of <em>sheol</em>; I am deprived of the residue
of my years.... Behold, for peace I had
great bitterness; but thou hast in love to my
soul delivered it from the <em>pit of corruption</em>; for
thou hast cast all my sins behind my back. For
<em>sheol cannot praise</em> thee, death cannot celebrate
thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope
for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall
praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the
children shall make known thy truth.” Isa. 38:10-19;
Ps. 115:17; 146:1-4.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Condition of the wicked in sheol.</em> They are
still and silent there. David, in a prayer indited
by the Spirit of God, says: “Let the wicked be
ashamed, and let them be silent in <em>sheol</em>.” Ps.
31:17. In 1 Sam. 2:9, we read that the wicked
shall be silent in darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>General character of sheol.</em> It is a place of
silence, secresy, sleep, rest, darkness, corruption,
and worms. Job says: “So man lieth down, and
riseth not: till the heavens be no more they shall
not awake nor be raised out of their sleep. Oh!
that thou wouldst hide me in <em>sheol</em>, that thou
wouldst keep me secret till thy wrath be past,
that thou wouldst appoint me a set time and remember
me. If a man die, shall he live again?
All the days of my appointed time will I wait
till my change come. Thou shalt call, and I will
answer thee; thou wilt have a desire to the work
of thine hands.” Job 14:12-15. Again he says:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“If I wait, <em>sheol</em> is mine house: I have made my
bed in the darkness. I have said to corruption,
Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my
mother and my sister. And where is now my
hope? As for my hope, who shall see it? They
shall go down to the bars of <em>sheol</em>, when our rest
together is in the <a id='corr160.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='dust.'>dust.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_160.7'><ins class='correction' title='dust.'>dust.”</ins></a></span> Job. 17:13-16; 4:11-19;
Ps. 88:10-12.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>There is no knowledge in sheol.</em> This fact is
plainly stated by Solomon through the Spirit of
inspiration: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to
do, do it with thy might; for there is no work,
nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in <em>sheol</em>
whither thou <a id='corr160.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='goest.'>goest.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_160.14'><ins class='correction' title='goest.'>goest.”</ins></a></span> Eccl. 9:4-6, 10. When
man goes in there his very thoughts perish. Ps.
146:4.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such are the great facts concerning <em>sheol</em>, or
hades, revealed to us in the books of “Moses and
the prophets.” Their statements are literal,
plain, explicit, and unequivocal. In opposition
to all these, can it be maintained that in <em>sheol</em>
and <em>hades</em> there <em>is</em> consciousness, wisdom, device,
knowledge, happiness, and misery, as is popularly
claimed on the authority of this record
about the rich man and Lazarus? If not, and if
<em>sheol</em> is such a place of silence, darkness, inactivity,
and unconsciousness, as they declare, can the
use of such language as is employed respecting
the rich man and Lazarus in this very place be
accounted for?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XX. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The previous chapter left us with the problem
on our hands whether it were better to try to
overthrow all that Moses and the prophets have
written respecting <em>sheol</em> and the condition of
those who enter therein, for the purpose of sustaining
the common view of the rich man and
Lazarus, or to try to account for the use of the
language used in that narrative, in harmony with
what Moses and the prophets have said respecting
that place.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, we cannot set aside what
Moses and the prophets have written; for Christ,
in the very case under consideration, indorses
them and refers us to them for instruction.
How, then, can we account for the fact that the
rich man is represented as conscious, intelligent,
and active, in <em>hades</em>, when Moses and the prophets
have taught us that <em>hades</em> is a place of darkness
and silence, without knowledge, wisdom, or
device? If the record of the rich man and
Lazarus is a parable, the use of such language
is at once accounted for; for if it is a parable,
the language is allegorical; and in allegory, life
and action are often attributed to inanimate objects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>for the sake of enforcing or illustrating
some particular truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some notable instances of this style of writing
are furnished us in the Old Testament. In
Judges 9:7-15, the trees are represented as going
forth to anoint a king over them; and they
appealed to the olive tree and the fig tree and
the vine, and received answers from them in
which they declined to leave their stations of usefulness
to be promoted over them. Finally, they
appealed to the bramble; and the bramble accepted
the trust. Now this representation was
not designed to teach that trees ordain civil government,
walk about, and converse together; but
it was to illustrate the folly of the men of Shechem
in electing Abimelech king. Again, in 2
Kings 14:9, we read that the king of Israel sent
to the king of Judah, saying, “The thistle in
Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,
saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife.”
This is not to teach that thistles and cedars have
sons and daughters who unite in marriage, but to
illustrate the contempt which the king of Israel
felt for the proposition which the king of Judah
made to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Landis, p. 188, claims that it makes no difference
whether the case of the rich man and Lazarus
is a parable or not, since a parable should
not be so worded as to convey a wrong impression
to the mind, which this would do, if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>soul is not conscious in death. We reply, It
makes all the difference in the world; for if it is
a parable, the life and action attributed to the
inanimate inhabitants of hades, is not to teach
anything respecting their real condition, any
more than the life and action attributed to the
trees and brambles in the cases referred to, is designed
to teach what their condition is; but this
intelligence and action are attributed to these inanimate
objects, to illustrate some great truth
which the speaker wished to enforce.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the case of the rich man and Lazarus, what
was the object in view? Answer: To rebuke
the Pharisees for their covetousness (“And the
Pharisees also, who were <em>covetous</em>, heard all these
things; and they derided him.” Verse 14); to
show to them, since they thought that riches in
this life was a mark of the divine favor and
would secure God’s blessing in the next, that if
they gave themselves up to the sensual enjoyment
of their riches, neglecting and oppressing
the poor, they would, in the future, meet God’s
wrath instead of his favor; and that the poor,
whom they despised and oppressed, might attain
to that very state of felicity, set forth under the
figure of Abraham’s bosom, of which they thought
themselves so sure.</p>

<p class='c011'>That this is a parable seems abundantly evident:
1. It stands in connection with a long
list of parables. The preceding chapter, Luke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>15, contains three. This chapter opens with the
parable of the unjust steward; and there is no
intimation of a change from parable to literal
narration in this case. 2. It is said that this cannot
be a parable, because it is introduced by a
direct assertion. “There was a certain rich
man,” &amp;c. But others which are parables are
introduced in exactly the same manner. Thus
verse 1, “There <em>was</em> a certain rich man which
had a steward,” &amp;c. And chapter 15:11: “A
certain man <em>had</em> two sons,” &amp;c. 3. The prophets,
to whom we are referred, speak of the dead
in <em>sheol</em>, in the nether parts of the earth, as conversing
together, taunting each other, weeping
bitterly, refusing to be comforted, &amp;c., representations
exactly similar to those made in the case
of the rich man and Lazarus, and full as striking,
but which no one can regard as setting forth the
actual condition of the dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus in Isa. 14:9-20, it is represented that
when the king of Babylon is overthrown, he goes
down into <em>sheol</em>, and the <span class='fss'>DEAD</span> (for there are no
others in its dark domain) are stirred up to meet
him. The kings that had been destroyed by the
king of Babylon, are represented as having
thrones in <em>sheol</em> beneath, and when the king of
Babylon joins them in their dark abode, they
rise up from their thrones, and mock him with
feigned obeisance, as in life they had rendered him
real homage. And they say, “Art thou become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>weak as we? Art thou become like unto us?
Is this the man that made the earth to tremble,
that did shake kingdoms?” No one can suppose
that they literally act or speak thus. But all this
is a striking figure to represent that death would
reduce the king of Babylon to the same level
with his subjects and prisoners.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again in Eze. 31:15-18, and 32:17-32, Pharaoh
and his host, slain in battle with the king
of Babylon, are set forth in the same manner. The
strong among the mighty are represented as
speaking to him out of the midst of <em>sheol</em>, as he
enters therein. And this <em>sheol</em>, in “the nether
parts of the earth,” full of graves and of the dead,
is contrasted with the land of the living. These
victims of slaughter went down to <em>sheol</em> with
their weapons of war; and their swords they
“laid under their heads;” and when Pharaoh,
lying among them, saw the multitude of his enemies
that were slain also, he was comforted at
the sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another case, perhaps still more remarkable,
is that of Rachel. Jer. 31:15-17; Matt. 2:17,
18; Gen. 25:17-20. Long ages after Rachel had
died, and entered into <em>sheol</em>, a dreadful slaughter
took place among her posterity. Thereupon she
is represented as breaking forth into lamentation
and bitter weeping, and refusing to be comforted
because her children were not. And the Lord
says to her, “Refrain thy voice from weeping,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and thine eyes from tears; for thy work shall be
rewarded, saith the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c011'>No one can suppose that Rachel literally wept
at the murder of her children nearly 2000 years
after her death, nor that the slaughtered Egyptians
put their swords under their heads as they
were lying in <em>sheol</em>, and conversed together in
the nether parts of the earth, some being comforted,
and others ashamed; nor that the kings
overthrown by the king of Babylon rose up from
their sepulchral thrones in mock solemnity, and
taunted him with becoming weak as they.</p>

<p class='c011'>But these were all figures to set forth great
and salutary truths. May not our Lord then, for
once, be permitted for a like purpose to use a
like figure, so largely employed by the prophets,
and so well known to his hearers, by personifying
persons in <em>hades</em> to perform actions which
were not there literally to occur? We have certainly
as good reason to suppose that Rachel, the
Egyptians, and the king of Babylon, were real
personages, and their descent into <em>sheol</em> and the
accompanying circumstance as related by the
prophets, veritable history, as to suppose that
Dives was a real character, and his torment in
<em>hades</em>, and his conversation with Abraham, a real
transaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who held in their hands the Old-Testament
scriptures were perfectly familiar with such
figures. There the “trees of the field” converse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and “clap their hands,” the “floods” lift up their
“voice,” the hills and mountains “sing,” stones
from the wall “cry out,” and beams “answer,”
the blood of Abel finds a “voice,” and “cries out
from the ground,” and dead men rejoice over the
fall of their rivals, slain by the sword. In a volume
abounding with such figures, cannot for
once a rich man, representing a class of living
persons, be endowed in <em>hades</em> with life and
speech? must this one figure of personification
be singled out from all others, as a rigidly literal
narrative, and be made to sustain the weight of
the most terrific doctrine of which the mind of
man can conceive?</p>

<p class='c011'>Sufficient evidence has been produced to show
that this is a parable. And now we invite the
attention of the reader to the testimony of two
eminent authors respecting the use which should
be made of parables.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Clarke (note on Matt. 5:26) says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Let it be remembered that by the consent of all (except
the basely interested), no <em>metaphor</em> is ever to be produced
in <em>proof</em> of a doctrine. In the things that concern
our eternal salvation, we need the most pointed and <em>express
evidence</em> on which to establish the faith of our souls.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>And Trench, in his work on parables, lays
down this very important rule:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The parables may not be made first sources of doctrine.
Doctrines otherwise and already grounded, may be illustrated,
or indeed further confirmed by them, but it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>allowable to constitute doctrine first by their aid. They
may be the outer ornamental fringe, but not the main
texture of the proof. For from the literal to the figurative,
from the clearer to the more obscure, has ever been
recognized as the law of Scripture interpretation. This
rule, however, has been <em>often forgotten</em>, and controversialists,
looking round for arguments with which to sustain
some <em>weak position</em>, one for which they can find no other
support in Scripture, often invent for themselves supports
in these.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>But some persist that this is not a parable, but
a literal narrative; and not to seem captious, we
will consider it in this light. If this is veritable
history, all the particulars must be taken literally.
Then the wicked, tormented in the flames
of hell, are within sight and speaking distance of
the saved in Heaven. In other words, Heaven
is but the shore of hell, and on that shore the redeemed
can sit and watch the damned in their
fearful contortions of agony for which there is
no name, and listen to their entreaties for relief
and their shrieks of fathomless despair, to an
extent, it would seem, sufficient to satisfy the
fiercest vengeance and the most implacable revenge.
If this be so, our friends must certainly
abandon the argument they build on Rev. 6:9,
10, where they have it that the souls of the martyrs,
disembodied and conscious, cry to God to
visit vengeance upon their persecutors. If they
were where they could look over into the fiery
gulf, and behold their persecutors vainly battling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>with its flaming billows, or if not already
there, destined in a few short years to be plunged
therein, let no one say of the holy martyrs that
they would, under such circumstances, cry impatiently
to God to hasten or intensify his vengeance.
The arguments based on the narrative
of the rich man and Lazarus, and Rev. 6:9, 10,
must, one or the other of them, be given up; for
they devour each other. Let the advocates of
the popular theory look to this.</p>

<p class='c011'>The beggar died, and was carried by the angels
into Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died,
and was buried. Let it be noted that the persons
themselves, as a whole, are spoken of, not
any of their essential elements, or immaterial
appendages. Nothing is said of the soul of either
the rich man or Lazarus. As we are now considering
this as a literal transaction, a question
vital to the argument is, <em>When</em> do the angels
bear those who have died, as persons (for there is
nothing anywhere said about the angels’ carrying
their souls), into Abraham’s bosom, or the state
of the blessed? Such scriptures as Matt. 24:30,
31; 1 Thess. 4:16, 17, answer this question very
explicitly: “And he shall send his angels with a
great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together
his elect from the four winds, from one end
of heaven to the other.” When? At the second
advent of the Son of man in majesty and glory;
for then it is that the voice of the archangel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>ringing through the long galleries of <em>hades</em>, shall
wake the righteous dead from their silent slumbers,
and angels bear them upward on wings of
light, to be forever with the Lord.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rich man dies, and is buried; and his next
experience is the suffering of torment in consuming
flame. How long after his burial he finds
himself in this torment, we are not directly informed.
But he has bodily organs; for he has
eyes to see, and a tongue to be cooled; but these
the dead are not usually considered to possess
till the resurrection. This drives Landis, p. 191,
to the unusual admission that the soul retains
the human form, with its corresponding organs,
hands, feet, eyes, tongue, &amp;c. Again, the rich
man sees Lazarus in Abraham’s bosom; but, as
we have already seen, Lazarus is not literally
borne there by the angels till the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a literal transaction, the scene is inevitably
located, by the concurrent testimony of all
Scripture, beyond the resurrection. How, then,
it can be said to transpire in <em>hades</em>, we leave
those to decide who believe that it is a literal
transaction. Certain it is that no such scenes
can really occur in <em>hades</em>, if the representations of
that place given us by Moses and the prophets
are correct; while analogous scenes will really
take place beyond the resurrection: there the
righteous are rewarded, and the wicked punished
in devouring fire; there the Lord told the impenitent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Jews that they should see Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of God, and
they themselves thrust out, and that then there
would be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Luke
13:28.</p>

<p class='c011'>One view, only, maintains harmony between
this and other portions of the sacred writings;
and that is the one which is here, imperfectly it
may be, but yet sincerely, advocated: that Christ,
following the example of the prophets, uses the
figure of personification, and anticipates, as transpiring
in the grave, scenes which substantially
occur beyond the resurrection; and that the object
of the parable was to rebuke the Pharisees
for their covetousness by indicating the fate that
awaited a life of avarice and oppression here,
however sumptuous that life might be.</p>

<p class='c011'>That it does not teach the existence of conscious
souls between death and the resurrection,
is forever settled by the fact that Lazarus could
return only by a resurrection from the dead.
When the rich man requested that Lazarus
might be sent to warn his brethren, Abraham
replied that they had Moses and the prophets,
and if they would not hear them, they would not
“be persuaded <em>though one rose from the dead</em>.”
The conversation did not therefore relate to the
coming back of the immortal soul of Lazarus;
and indeed no mention is made of any such thing
in the whole transaction.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Therefore, interpret it as we may, it cannot
be reasonably or scripturally used to prove the
entrance of man’s naked, unclothed spirit into
bliss or woe at the hour of death.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXI. <br /> <span class='fss'>WITH ME IN PARADISE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>According to Luke’s account of the crucifixion
of our Saviour, Luke 23:27-46, one of the
two malefactors who were crucified with him,
said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when thou
comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto
him, Verily, I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou
be with me in Paradise.” Verses 42, 43. This,
says the immaterialist, “must ever stand as a
clear announcement of the uninterrupted immortality
of the soul.” (<cite>Landis</cite>, p. 211.) The “clear
announcement” is made out in this manner:
Christ and the thief, it is claimed, both died
that day; they both went to paradise that day;
and their condition while there was, of course,
one of consciousness and intelligence.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is one fact which stands somewhat in
the way of this clear announcement; and that
is, that <em>Christ did not go to paradise that day</em>.
In answer to the popular view, we first set forth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>this unqualified proposition, and undertake its
proof; and if this shall prove to be well grounded,
the doctrine of annihilation will be found in
a degree true; for the claims usually built on
the scripture above quoted are utterly and forever
annihilated by this fact.</p>

<p class='c011'>In entering upon the argument to show that
Christ did not go to paradise that day, we first
inquire what paradise is and where it is. The
word occurs but three times in the English version
of the Scriptures, all in the New Testament;
two besides the verse under consideration; but
these are amply sufficient to define and locate it.</p>

<p class='c011'>First, Paul in 2 Cor. 12:2, says: “I knew a
man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether
in the body I cannot tell; or whether out of the
body, I cannot tell; God knoweth), such an one
caught up to the third Heaven.” In verse 4, he
affirms that the place to which this man was
caught up was paradise. This establishes the
fact that paradise is in the third Heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, in Rev. 2:7, we read the promise
which the Saviour gives to the overcomers; and
he says: “To him that overcometh will I give
to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst
of the paradise of God.” This establishes another
equally important fact, that paradise is
where the tree of life now is. Now, if the
Scriptures anywhere give us any further information
respecting the place where the tree of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>life is to be found, we have still further testimony
respecting paradise.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Rev. 21 and 22, we have a description of
the New Jerusalem, the holy city which is above.
In chap. 22:1, 2, we read: “And he showed
me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the
Lamb. In the midst of the street of it [the city],
and on either side of the river, was there the
tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruit,
and yielded her fruit every month.” By this
testimony, we learn that the tree of life, which
grows in the midst of the paradise of God, is in
the holy city, fast by the river of life, which
proceeds from the throne of God. Nothing
could be more explicit than this. We have now
found the paradise of the New Testament. It is
in the third Heaven, where the tree of life is,
and where God maintains his residence and his
throne. Whoever, therefore, goes into paradise,
goes into the presence of God. If the Saviour
went there on the day of his crucifixion, with
the impenitent thief, he went into the presence
of his Father.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now let us reverently listen to the words of
the Lord and believe what he says, while he
himself testifies whether he went to paradise on
the day of his crucifixion, or not. On the morning
of his resurrection, the <em>third day</em> after his crucifixion,
he said to Mary, who was about to embrace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>his feet, in accordance with the ancient
custom of deference or worship, “Touch me not;
FOR I AM NOT YET ASCENDED TO MY
FATHER.” The third day, remember, from the
crucifixion, and not ascended into paradise yet!</p>

<p class='c011'>Struck into a state of bewilderment by this
stunning fact, Landis, pp. 209, 211, clutches
wildly for some supports by which to rear again
his prostrate structure. He feigns to find evidence
in John 16:16, that Jesus told his disciples
that at death he would go to his Father: a
scripture which very evidently has reference, not
to his death, but to his bodily ascension, forty
days after his resurrection. Then, referring to
the fact that the word “ascend” is from <em>anabaino</em>,
he says: “Now every tyro knows that in
composition <em>ana</em> has very frequently [?] the
force of <em>again</em>. <em>Baino</em> alone means simply <em>to
ascend</em>; <em>ana</em> adds a shade of meaning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is frequently the case that writers try to
drive others into an admission of their statements
by representing that they will appear very ignorant
and stupid to deny them. But Mr. L., not
being a tyro, doubtless understands that nearly
every statement in this criticism is false in itself
considered, and every one of them wholly so, as
applied to the case in hand. <em>Ana</em>, in composition
with <em>baino</em>, does not have the force of again.
In neither Liddell and Scott, Robinson, Greenfield,
nor Parkhurst, is there any such definition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>as “ascended again” given to <em>anabaino</em>. <em>Baino</em>
alone does not mean “to ascend.” No such definition
is given to it in the standard authorities
here named. It means simply to go, without
any reference to the direction; other words,
either in composition with it, or in the context,
signifying whether this motion is up or down,
forward or backward, over or under, &amp;c. In no
one of the eighty-one instances of the use of the
word in the New Testament, is it translated
“ascend again.” And finally, those texts which
Mr. L. quotes as containing the word again, as
Matt. 3:16, which he quotes, “Christ <em>went up
again</em>, or returned,” and Matt. 5:1, which he
quotes, “He went up <em>again</em> into a mountain,”
the word, again, is not expressed in the English
nor implied in the Greek. In only one instance
is the word again used with <em>anabaino</em>; that is
Gal. 2:1, where Paul says, “I went up <em>again</em>
to Jerusalem;” but here the word again is from
another word (<em>palin</em>), and <em>anabaino</em> is translated
simply “went up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rarely do we meet with an instance of more
reckless desperation in the line of criticism. And
what is the object of it? It is to have us understand
that when Christ says, “I am not yet
ascended to my Father,” he means to say, I am
not yet ascended <em>again</em> to my Father. And from
this he would have us further draw the lucid inference
that Christ had ascended once, that is, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>his disembodied spirit, between his death and
resurrection, and now tells Mary not to touch him
because he has not ascended again! It would be
difficult to conceive of a more unnecessary and
far-fetched inference. And that men will seriously
contend for such a view, shows the orbless
obstinacy with which they will cling to preconceived
notions, though they have only the most
groundless trifles to sustain them, rather than
surrender them for more consistent views. Nothing
can be more evident than that Christ, when
he said, “I am not yet ascended to my Father,”
affirmed in the most direct manner that since his
advent into this world, he had not, up to that
time, ascended to his Father.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rather than thus summarily lose the argument
that the thief was still conscious in death, and
that the soul is therefore (?) immortal, another
attempt is made to adjust the matter thus: Although
Christ did not go to his Father, he nevertheless
went to paradise, which is not where the
Father dwells, but the intermediate resting place
of departed souls. Do we then understand them?
We found them, a little while ago, arguing from
Eccl. 12:7, that the disembodied spirit <em>did</em> return
to God; which they claimed to be proof positive
that the soul is immortal; and thought it would
puzzle the annihilationists not a little. Do they
now give this up, and admit that the soul or spirit
does not go to God, but only into some intermediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>place, called paradise? It matters not to
us which position they take, only we wish to
know which one it is. We cannot hold our peace
and allow them to take one position on one text
and another on another, to avoid the embarrassments
into which their theory plunges at every
turn.</p>

<p class='c011'>That paradise is no intermediate state, a halfway
house between the grave and the resurrection,
we have fully shown; for we have the positive
statements of the Scriptures to show that
paradise is in the third Heaven, where God sits
upon his throne; and Christ told Mary, the third
day after his crucifixion, in so many words, that
he had not yet ascended there.</p>

<p class='c011'>The popular interpretation of Christ’s language
to the thief thus utterly failing, we are thrown
back upon the text for some other explanation
of the phraseology there used: “Verily I say
unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There are but two probable ways in which this
language can be interpreted: One is, to let the
phrase, “to-day,” refer to the time to which the
thief had reference in his request. He said, “Lord,
remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.”
He looked forward to the day when Christ
should come into his kingdom. And if the “to-day”
in Christ’s answer refers to this time, then
the sense would be, “Verily I say unto thee, To-day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>or this day, the day to which you refer, when
I come into my kingdom, thou shalt be with me
in paradise.” The word, to-day, is from the
Greek, σήμερον (<em>semeron</em>); and all the definitions
we find of it would seem to confine it to present
time, excluding an application of it to the future.
This interpretation, therefore, we think cannot
be urged.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other, and only remaining method of interpreting
the passage, is to place the comma after
“to-day,” making to-day an adverb qualifying
say. The sense would then be, Verily I say unto
thee to-day, thou shalt be with me in paradise,
at that period in the future when I shall come in
my kingdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>This method of punctuation, if it is allowable,
clears the subject of all difficulty. Let us then
candidly consider what objections can be urged
against it.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the punctuation itself, we all know that
that is not the work of inspiration, and withal
that it is of recent origin, the comma in its present
form not having been invented till the year
<span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1790. It is therefore allowable to change
this in any manner that the sense of the passage,
the context, or even other portions of the Scriptures
may demand. And in support of this
punctuation, we have the example of some Greek
manuscripts, which, according to Griesbach, place
the comma after “to-day” in this declaration.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>But the objector accuses us of making sad
nonsense of the text by this change; and he
asks, in bitter irony, “Didn’t the thief know it
was that day, without Christ’s telling him?”
Very true, as a matter of fact; but let the objector
beware lest his sarcasm fall upon the
Scriptures themselves; for such very expressions
do occur therein. See Zech. 9:12: “Turn you
to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even
<em>to-day</em> do I declare that I will render double
unto thee.” Transposing this sentence, without
altering the sense, we have phraseology similar
to that of Luke 23:43; namely, “I declare
unto you even to-day, I will render double unto
thee.” The events threatened here were to take
place in the future, when the Lord should bend
Judah, &amp;c. See context. So the phrase, “to-day,”
could not qualify the “rendering double,”
&amp;c., but only the declaration.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, then, is an expression exactly parallel
with that in Luke, and the same irony is applicable;
thus, “Did not the prisoners of hope know
it was that day when the declaration was made
to them?” But let our opponents now discard
their unworthy weapon; for here it is leveled
against the words of Inspiration itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when we take into consideration the circumstances
of the case, we see a force and propriety
in the Saviour’s making his declaration
emphatically upon that day. He had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>preaching the advent of the kingdom of Heaven
to listening multitudes. A kingdom, he had
promised to his followers. But the powers of
death and darkness had apparently triumphed,
and were crushing into the very grave both his
prospects and his promises. He who was expected
to be the king of the coming kingdom,
stretched upon the shameful cross, was expiring
in ignominy and reproach; his disciples were
scattered; and where now was the prospect of
that kingdom which had been preached and
promised? But amid the supernatural influences
at work upon that memorable day, a ray
of divine illumination may have flashed in upon
the soul of the poor thief, traveling the same
road of death beside his Lord. A conviction of
the truthfulness of his claims as the Messiah, the
Son of God, may have entered into his mind,
and a desire have sprung up in his heart to trust
his lot in his hands, leading him to put up a
humble and sincere petition, Lord, in mercy remember
me when the days of thy triumph and
glory shall come. Yes, says the suffering Saviour,
in the hearing of the mocking multitude,
I say unto thee, <em>to-day</em>--to-day, in this hour of
my darkness and agony--to-day, when the fatal
cross is apparently giving the lie to all my pretensions--to-day,
a day of forlorn prospects and
withered hopes, so far as human eyes can see--verily,
<em>to-day</em>, I say unto thee, thou shalt be with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>me in paradise, when my kingdom shall be established
in triumph and glory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, there is a divine force and beauty in
these words of our Lord, as uttered on that occasion.
How like a sun at midnight would they
have broken in upon the gloom that enshrouded
the sorrowing hearts of the disciples, had they
fathomed their import. For who had occasion
to sink in despair, if not He upon whom all depended,
and that, too, when expiring under the
agonies of the cross. But lo! no cloud of gloom
is sufficient to fix its shadows upon his serene
brow. His divine foresight, riding calmly over
the events of the present, fixes itself upon that
coming period of glory, when he shall see of the
travail of his soul and be satisfied. There, in
the hour of his deepest humility, he points them
to the joys of paradise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, by a simple removal of the comma one
word forward, the stone of stumbling is taken
out of this text, by making it harmonize with
other Scriptures; and thus, the promise, by having
reference to something in the future, and not
to anything to be performed on that day, contains
no affirmation of consciousness in death.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXII. <br /> <span class='fss'>ABSENT FROM THE BODY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Another passage, supposed to teach the separate
conscious existence of the soul, is found in 2
Cor. 5:8: “We are confident, I say, and willing
rather, to be absent from the body, and to be
present with the Lord.” On the acknowledged
principle that it is illogical to endeavor to build
any great doctrine upon an isolated passage,
without taking into consideration the general
tenor of the context, if not also other writings
from the same author, let us look at some of the
statements which Paul has made in this connection.</p>

<p class='c011'>In verse 1 of this chapter, Paul introduces an
earthly house and a heavenly house, and says,
“For we know that if our earthly house of this
tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of
God, an house not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens.” He states our condition while in
the earthly house. Verse 2: “In this we groan,”
verse 4, “being burdened.” He tells what we
desire in this state. Verse 2. “Earnestly desiring
to be clothed upon with our house which is
from Heaven [verse 3]: if so be that being
clothed, we shall not be found naked.” In verse
4, Paul repeats all these facts in order to state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the result of the work which he desired: “For
we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being
burdened: not for that we would be unclothed,
but clothed upon.” Now he states the result of
being clothed upon with the house from Heaven
which he so earnestly desired: “But clothed
upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of
life.” Then he states that the condition he had
in view is that for which God in the beginning
designed the human race: “Now he that has
wrought us for the self-same thing is God.”
That is, God designed that we should ultimately
reach that condition which he here designates as
being clothed upon with our house from Heaven.
Then he states what assurance we have in this
life that we shall eventually attain to this condition:
“who also hath given unto us the earnest
[assurance, pledge, token] of the Spirit.” That
is, the Spirit dwelling in our hearts, is the assurance
or pledge we have that we shall finally receive
the desire of our hearts, and be clothed
upon with our house from Heaven. In verse 6,
he states this to be the ground of his confidence,
although while “we are at home in the body, we
are absent from the Lord.” And then after incidentally
stating the secret of the Christian’s
course in this life, “we walk by faith, not by
sight,” he penned the text quoted at the commencement
of this chapter, stating that he was
willing rather to be absent from the body and to
be present with the Lord.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>We now have before us quite fully, the subject
upon which Paul is here treating. A thought
now as to the meaning of the terms he employs.
What does he mean by the earthly house and
the heavenly house? by being clothed and unclothed?
by mortality being swallowed up of
life? and by being absent from the body and
present with the Lord?</p>

<p class='c011'>What he calls in verse 1, “our earthly house,”
he designates in verse 6, as being “at home in
the body.” The chief characteristic of this house
is that it may be dissolved, or is mortal. This
earthly house is therefore our mortal body, or
what is essentially the same thing, this present
mortal condition. The house from Heaven is
eternal or immortal. This, therefore, by parity
of reasoning, is the immortal body or the state
of immortality which awaits the redeemed beyond
the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul, in Rom. 8:22, 23, speaks very plainly
of these two conditions: “For we know that
the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain together until now. And not only they,
but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of
the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption
of our body.” None can fail to see the
parallel between this passage in Romans, and
that portion of 2 Cor. 5, now under consideration.
To the Corinthians, Paul says, that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>our earthly house we groan, being burdened; to
the Romans, that we groan within ourselves, or
in this mortal body; to the Corinthians, that
while in this state we have the earnest of the
Spirit; to the Romans, that we have the first-fruits
of the Spirit, which is the same thing, the
pledge, assurance, or earnest; to the Corinthians,
that we desire to be clothed upon with our house
from Heaven; to the Romans, that we wait for
the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
The ultimate object in view in both cases, as a
matter of hope and desire, is the redeemed or
eternal state; but in the one case it is being
“clothed upon with our house from Heaven,”
and in the other, it is “the redemption of our
body.” These two expressions, therefore, denote
one and the same thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Returning to a consideration of the meaning
of the terms which Paul uses, we inquire what
is meant by being unclothed. And the evident
answer is, The dissolution of our earthly house,
or the falling of our mortal body in death. The
state of death, then, is that condition in which
we are unclothed. And the being clothed upon,
is being released from this state, when mortality
is swallowed up of life, and we are taken into
the presence of the Lord. Then Paul states a
conclusion very apparent from his premises, that
while we are at home in the body we are absent
from the Lord, and adds that he is willing rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>to be absent from the body and present with the
Lord.</p>

<p class='c011'>The only verse in which consciousness in death
can even be supposed to be intimated, is the 8th
verse, which speaks of our being absent from the
body and present with the Lord. But even here
it will be seen that the whole question turns on
the time when we enter the presence of the
Lord. Is it immediately on the dissolution of
our earthly house? This the text does not inform
us; but on this the preceding verses are
very explicit, as we shall presently see.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us now look at a few considerations which
show that it is impossible to harmonize the popular
view of consciousness in death, with the
statements which the apostle here makes. It is
claimed that the house which we have eternal in
the Heavens is the immortal soul with which we
immediately enter into Heaven when the earthly
house is dissolved. Granting that this is so, let
us go forward a little and mark the difficulty in
which this view is involved. The time comes
when the mortal body is raised from the dead
and made immortal. In these redeemed bodies
we are to live in the kingdom of God to all eternity.
This is finally our eternal house. But
when we take possession of this, what becomes
of our house that we occupied between death
and the resurrection? If we pass from our mortal
bodies at death immediately into a spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>body prepared for us, which is the house we
have in Heaven, and in which we live till the
resurrection, when our natural bodies are redeemed,
and we take possession of them, it necessarily
follows that we vacate that second house
which we had occupied in Heaven. Then what
becomes of that house? Moreover this view introduces
something before us of which Paul has
made no mention; for here we have three houses,
but Paul’s language allows of only two; and one
of these three houses, on the view before us, has
to be abandoned, to go to ruin, when we take possession
of our redeemed bodies. All this is unscriptural
and absurd. Such a view is an impossibility.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, Paul affirms in verse 5 that God hath
wrought us for this self-same thing, that is, created
man for such a state of being as we shall
enjoy, when clothed upon with our house from
Heaven. Is this condition the separate existence
of an immortal soul? No; for if man had never
sinned, he would have reached that state without
seeing death, and the idea of an immortal
soul would never have had an existence. The
whole doctrine is the offspring of sin, for it is the
result of the fall. It is the second falsehood
which the devil found necessary to sustain his
first one, “Ye shall not surely die.” For when
all that is outward, tangible, and visible of man
does fall in death, his untruth would be very apparent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>unless he could make them believe that
there is an invisible medium through which
they still continue to live. Paul, therefore, in
the scripture under notice, does not have any reference
to an intermediate state.</p>

<p class='c011'>He further says that we have through the
Spirit an earnest, or pledge, that this condition,
which is set forth as the chief object of desire,
will finally be reached, and we shall be clothed
with our house from Heaven. But what is the
Holy Spirit in our hearts an earnest or pledge
of? What does it signify that we have a measure
of the Holy Spirit here? Is it a proof or assurance
that we have immortal souls that will
live when the body is dead? No, but that we
shall be redeemed and made immortal. See Eph.
1:13, 14: “In whom also, after that ye believed,
ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the
redemption of the purchased possession, unto the
praise of his glory.” And in Rom. 8:11, Paul
again says: “But if the Spirit of Him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
that raised up Christ from the dead shall also
quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
dwelleth in you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These are the glorious promises of which the
Holy Spirit in our hearts is a pledge and assurance:
that these mortal bodies shall be quickened
from the dead, even as Christ was raised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>up, and that we shall share in the inheritance,
when the purchased possession shall be redeemed.
It looks not to any intermediate state, but to the
ultimate reward.</p>

<p class='c011'>And finally, Paul forever bars his teaching
against the entrance of the conscious state dogma,
by saying that when we are clothed upon with
our house from Heaven, mortality is swallowed
up of life. How can mortality be swallowed up
of life? It can be only by having a principle of
life come upon it which shall overpower and absorb
it. Mortality can be swallowed up only by
immortality or eternal life. Is this the passing
of the soul from the mortal body at the hour of
death? Let us look at it. What is there about
man, according to the common view, which is
mortal? The body. And what is immortal?
The soul. At death, the body, that part which
is mortal, does not become immortal, but loses all
its life, and goes into the grave to crumble back
to dust. And the soul, which was immortal before,
is no more than immortal afterward. Is
there any swallowing up of mortality by life
here? Just the reverse. Mortality, or the mortal
part, is swallowed up by death. There is not
so much life afterward as before; for after death,
the soul only lives, while the body, which was
alive before, is now dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Paul, before penning this language in
2 Cor. 5, had already told the Corinthians when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>mortality would be swallowed up of life, and how
it would be accomplished; so he knew when he
penned this portion of his second epistle that they
would understand it perfectly. See the 15th
chapter of his first epistle, verses 51-55: “Behold
I show you a mystery: we shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
mortal must put on immortality. So when this
corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
this mortal shall have put on immortality, then
shall be brought to pass the saying that is written,
Death is swallowed up in victory. O death,
where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy <a id='corr191.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='victory.'>victory?</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_191.16'><ins class='correction' title='victory.'>victory?</ins></a></span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>In verse 50, he says: “Now this I say, brethren,
that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.”
Corruption does not inherit, or
possess, incorruption. Mortality does not possess
immortality. The mortal body does not inclose
an immortal principle, which it has power to
hold within its grasp, till that grasp is rendered
nerveless by the stroke of death, and the soul
flies away in glad release. But this mortal, all
that there is about man that is mortal, must put
on, must be itself invested with, immortality, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>this corruptible, all about us that is perishable,
must itself become incorruptible; then it will
not be this corruptible flesh and blood, and then
it can inherit the kingdom of God, and start off
bold and vigorous on its race of endless life; and
outside of this change, and independent of this
grand investiture of our mortal nature with immortality,
there is no eternal life for any of the
race. And when this is accomplished, then death
is swallowed up in victory; then we are clothed
upon with our house from Heaven; then mortality
is swallowed up of life. But this is not at
death, but at the last trump, when the Lord appears
in glory, and the dead are raised, and the
righteous living are changed in the twinkling of
an eye. How can the religious world stumble
in a path so plain!</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the heavenly house is our future immortal
body, it may be asked how Paul can say,
as he does in 2 Cor. 5:1, “We have [present
tense] a building of God, an house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens.” We have this in
the same sense that we have, at the present time,
eternal life. And John tells us how this is: It
is by faith, or by promise, not by actual possession.
1 John 5:11: “And this is the record,
that God hath given to us eternal life.” God
hath given it to us; and on the strength of this
promise we have it. But where is it now?
“And this life is”--in us? No, but--“in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Son.” And when he, the Son, who is our life,
shall appear, we shall be clothed upon with our
heavenly house, and appear with him in glory.
Col. 3:4.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, it may be asked how Paul can speak of
two houses, as though we moved from one into
the other, if it is only a change of condition from
mortal to immortality. He illustrates this in the
figure he takes to represent conversion. Eph.
4:22-24: “That ye put off concerning the former
conversation the old man, which is corrupt according
to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the
spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new
man, which after God is created in righteousness
and true holiness.” Here the simple change of
heart, the change of the disposition, from sin to
holiness, is spoken of as putting off one man and
putting on another. With even greater propriety,
may the change from mortal to immortality
be spoken of as removing from an earthly, perishable
house, to an immortal, heavenly one.</p>

<p class='c011'>The terms Paul uses to describe the two states,
are clearly defined. On the one side it is an
earthly house, groaning with burdens, mortality,
absent from the Lord. On the other, it is clothed
upon with our house from Heaven, mortality
swallowed up of life, present with the Lord. He
did not desire to be unclothed, which, as already
noticed, signifies the condition of death; but he
did desire to be present with the Lord; therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>in death he would have us understand that
the Christian is not present with the Lord.</p>

<p class='c011'>From all this, we can only conclude that
when he says he is willing to be absent from the
body and present with the Lord, he means to be
understood that he is willing that this burdened,
groaning, mortal state should end, and the promised
glorious and eternal day begin. And being
confident, through the presence of the Spirit of
God in his heart, that when this change should
be wrought, he would have a glorious part therein,
he was more than willing it should come. It
was but the breathing again of that prayer which
has arisen like a continual sigh from the heart of
the church through all her weary pilgrimage,
“Thy kingdom come; yea, come, Lord Jesus,
come quickly;” not, “Let our immortal souls,”
which they did not suppose they possessed,
“enter a conscious state in death” in which they
did not believe.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIII. <br /> <span class='fss'>IN THE BODY AND OUT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It is confidently asserted that Paul believed a
man could exist independently of the body from
certain expressions which he uses in 2 Cor. 12:
2-4:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago,
(whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of
the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one
caught up to the third Heaven. And I knew such a man,
whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell:
God knoweth;) how that he was caught up into paradise,
and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful
for a man to utter.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>By the man whom he knew, it is generally
supposed that the apostle means himself, and the
language he uses is a record of his own experience.
Paul was taken to the third Heaven, to
paradise, and heard words which it is not possible
for a man to utter; but whether it was in
his body, or out, he did not know.</p>

<p class='c011'>This instance, then, furnishes no example of a
spirit actually existing in a conscious condition
outside of the body, even if this is what is meant
by the expression, “out of the body;” for Paul
assures us that he did not know that he was in
that condition. Yet it is claimed that it has all
the force of an actual example; for such a condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>is recognized as possible. It is very readily
admitted that such a condition is recognized, as
is expressed by the terms, “out of the body;” but
that this means an immaterial spirit, an immortal
soul, the real, intelligent man, speeding away
through the universe even to the third Heaven,
there to hear unspeakable words, and gather up
heavenly information, and return at will to resume
its abode in the, for a time, deserted body,
should not be too hastily inferred from this passage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of what is the apostle speaking? He says, in
verse 1: “It is not expedient for me, doubtless,
to glory. I will come to visions and revelations
of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ, above
fourteen years ago,” &amp;c., as previously quoted.
His subject, then, is the visions and revelations
he had received from the Lord; and the language
from verse 2 to verse 4 is the record of
one such remarkable revelation, perhaps the most
remarkable one he had ever experienced. He
was given a view of paradise, and heard unspeakable
words. And so real and clear and vivid was
the view, that he did not know but that he was
transported bodily into that place. If not in
this manner, the view was given in the ordinary
course of vision, that is, by having the scene presented
before the mind by the power of the Holy
Ghost.</p>

<p class='c011'>All must concede that only these two conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>are brought to view, either his transportation
bodily to paradise, or the ordinary condition
of being in vision. If he went bodily to paradise,
the instance has no bearing of course on the
question of consciousness in death. And if it
was an ordinary vision, how does this prove consciousness
in death? The question is reduced to
this one point; and the answer turns on the definition
given to the expression, “out of the body.”
Did Paul mean by it, what modern expositors
wish us to understand by it? Paul meant by it,
simply being in vision; the expositors aforesaid
mean by it, the going out of the immortal spirit
from the body, and its existence for a time in a
separate conscious intelligent condition independent
of the body. But let us look a little further,
and see what this condition is. According to the
common view, the separation of the soul from
the body is death. This is what death is defined
to mean. There can be no such thing as the
separation of soul and body, and death not result.
And the return of the soul to again inhabit the
body, is a resurrection from the dead. This is
what is claimed in the case of Rachel, whose soul
departed, and she died, Gen. 35:18, and the widow’s
son whom Elijah raised, whose soul came
into him again, and he revived. 1 Kings 17:22.</p>

<p class='c011'>But does any one suppose that Paul meant to
say that he did not know but that he died and
had a resurrection? That is what he did say, if
the words, “out of the body,” mean what some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>would have us understand by them. His soul
went off to paradise, and his body lay here, we
know not how long, a corpse upon the earth!
And when his soul returned, he had a resurrection
from the dead! A necessary conclusion so
preposterous, must be sufficient to convince any
one that Paul, by the expression, “out of the
body,” does not mean a state of death. He simply
means that he was in vision, a state in which
the mind, controlled for the time by the Holy
Ghost, is made to take cognizance of distant or
future scenes, and the person seems to himself to
be really and bodily present, viewing the scenes,
and listening to the words that are spoken, before
him. Dreams, which all have experienced,
are doubtless good illustrations of how this can
be, and the case of John, in the Revelation, furnishes
a notable example; for he was carried forward
far into the future, and seemed to be present
and taking part in scenes that did not then
exist, and at which he could not really have been
present, even in his supposed immaterial immortal
soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul, then, had no reference whatever to a
state of death in 2 Cor. 12:2-4. To suppose
him to refer to that, according to the immaterialist
view, runs us into the greatest absurdity.
Hence his language affords no proof that there is
a soul in man which can live on in a conscious
intelligent state, while the mortal body crumbles
back to dust.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIV. <br /> <span class='fss'>DEPARTING AND BEING WITH CHRIST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>When will all men come to agree respecting
the state of the dead? When will the question
whether the dead are alive, conscious, active, and
intelligent, or whether they rest in the grave in
unconsciousness and inactivity, cease to be a
vexed question? When shall it be decided
whether the shout of triumph which the ransomed
are to raise, “O death, where is thy sting?
O grave, where is thy victory?” is the celebration
of a real victory, or only an unnecessary and
useless transaction, as it must be if the grave
holds not the real man, but only the shell, the
mortal body, which is generally considered an
incumbrance and a clog? Never will this question
be decided till men shall be willing to follow
the Scriptures, instead of trying to compel the
Scriptures to follow them; never, while they
put the figurative for the literal, and the literal
for the figurative, mistake sound for sense, and
rest on the possible construction of an isolated
text, instead of, and in opposition to, the general
tenor of the teaching of the inspired writers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul has told us often enough, and it would
seem explicitly enough, when the Christian goes
to be with his Lord. It is at the redemption of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the body. Rom. 8:23. It is in the day of the
Lord Jesus. 1 Cor. 5:5. It is at the last trump.
1 Cor. 15:51-55. It is when we are clothed
upon with our house from Heaven. 2 Cor. 5:4.
It is when Christ our life shall appear. Col. 3:4.
It is when the Lord descends from Heaven with
a shout, and the dead are raised. 1 Thess. 4:16,
17. It is at the coming of the Lord. 2 Thess.
2:1. It is to be at “that day,” an expression by
which Paul frequently designates the day of
Christ’s appearing. 2 Tim. 4:7, 8.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet Paul, in one instance, without stopping to
explain, uses the expression, “to depart and to
be with Christ;” whereupon his words are seized
by religious teachers as unanswerable evidence
that at death the spirit enters at once into the
presence of its Redeemer. The passage is found
in Phil. 1:21-24, and reads as follows:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. But if I
live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I
shall choose I wot not. For I am in a strait betwixt two,
having a desire to depart and to be with Christ; which is
far better. Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more
needful for you.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Willing to go with our friends as far as we can
in their interpretation of any passage, we raise
no issue here on the word depart. Paul probably
means by it the same as in 2 Tim. 4:6,
where he says, “The time of my departure is at
hand,” referring to his approaching death. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Paul, immediately on dying, was to be with
Christ. Not so fast. The very point intended
to be proved has, in such a conclusion, to be assumed.
Paul had in view two conditions: this
present state, and the future state. Between
these two he was in a strait. The cause of God
on earth, the interests of the church, stirring to
its very depths his large and sympathetic heart,
drew him here; his own desires drew him to the
future state of victory and rest. And so evenly
balanced were the influences drawing him in
either direction, that he hardly knew upon
which course he would decide, were it left to
him as a matter of choice. Nevertheless, he said
that it was more needful for the church that he
remain here, to give them still the benefit of his
counsel and his labors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The state or condition to which he looked forward
was one which he greatly desired. About
four years before he wrote these words to the
Philippians, he had written to the Corinthians,
telling them what he did desire, and what he did
not desire, in reference to the future. Said he,
“Not that we would be unclothed.” 2 Cor. 5:4.
By being unclothed, he meant the state of death,
from the cessation of mortal life to the resurrection.
This he did not desire; but he immediately
adds what he did desire, namely, to be
“clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed
up of life;” and when this is done, all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>is mortal of us is made immortal, the dead are
raised, and the body is redeemed. Rom. 8:23;
1 Cor. 15:52, 53.</p>

<p class='c011'>In writing to the Corinthians, he thus stated
that the object of his desire was to be clothed
upon, and have mortality swallowed up of life;
to the Philippians he stated that the object of
his desire was to be with Christ. These expressions,
then, mean the same thing. Therefore, in
Phil. 1:23, Paul passes over the state of death,
the unclothed state, just as he had done to the
Corinthians; for he would not tell the Corinthians
that he did not desire a certain state, and
four years after write to the Philippians that he
did desire it. Paul did not thus contradict himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this intermediate state is the disputed territory
in this controversy; the condition of the
dead therein is the very point in question: and
on this the text before us is entirely silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is the vulnerable point in the popular argument
on this text. It is assumed that the being
with Christ takes place immediately on the
departure. But, while the text asserts nothing
of this kind, multitudes of other texts affirm that
the point when we gain immortality and the
presence of Christ, is a point in the future beyond
the resurrection. And, unless some necessary
connection can be shown between the departing
and the being with Christ, and the hosts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>of texts which make our entrance into Christ’s
presence a future event can be harmonized therewith,
any attempt to prove consciousness in
death from this text is an utter failure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Landis seems to feel the weakness of his side
in this respect, and spends the strength of his argument,
pp. 224-229, in trying to make the inference
appear necessary that the being with
Christ must be immediate on the departure. He
would have us think it utterly absurd and nonsensical
to suppose a moment to elapse between
the two events.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us then see if there is anything in Paul’s
language which contradicts the idea that a period
of utter unconsciousness, of greater or less length,
intervenes between death and our entrance into
the future life. In the first place, if the unconsciousness
is absolute, as we suppose, the space
passed over in the individual’s experience is an
utter blank. There is not the least perception,
with such person, of the lapse of a moment of
time. When consciousness returns, the line of
thought is taken up at the very point where it
ceased, without the consciousness of a moment’s
interruption. This fact is often proved by actual
experience. Persons have been known to become
utterly unconscious by a fracture of the skull,
and a portion of it being depressed upon the
brain, suspending its action. Perhaps when the
accident happened they were in the act of issuing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>an order, or giving directions to those about
them. They have lain unconscious for months,
and then been relieved by a surgical operation;
and when the brain began again to act, and
consciousness returned, they have immediately
spoken and completed the sentence they were in
the act of uttering when they were struck down,
months before. This shows that to these persons
there was no consciousness of any time intervening,
more than what passes between the words
of a sentence which we are speaking. It was all
the same to them as if they had at once completed
the sentence they commenced to utter, instead
of having weeks and months of unconsciousness
thrown in between the words of which that
sentence was composed.</p>

<p class='c011'>So with the dead. They are not aware of the
lapse of a moment of time between their death
and the resurrection. A wink of the eye shuts
out for an instant the sight of all objects, but it
is so instantaneous that we do not perceive any
interruption of the rays of vision. Six thousand
years in the grave to a dead man is no more than
a wink of the eye to the living. To them, consciousness,
our only means of measuring time, is
gone; and it will seem to them when they awake
that absolutely none has elapsed. When Abel
awakes from the dead, it will seem to him, until
his attention is attracted by the new scenes of
immortality to which he will be raised, that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>is rising up from the murderous blows of Cain,
under which he had seemingly just fallen. And
to Stephen, who died beholding the exaltation of
Christ in Heaven, it will be the same as if he
had, without a moment’s interruption, entered
into his glorious presence. And when Paul himself
shall be raised, it will seem to him that the
stroke of the executioner was his translation to
glory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such being the indisputable evidence of facts
upon this point, we ask how a person, understanding
this matter, would speak of the future
life, if he expected to obtain it in the kingdom of
God? Would he speak of passing long ages in
the grave before he reached it? He might, if he
designed to state, for any one’s instruction, the
actual facts in the case; but if he was speaking
simply of his own experience, it would not be
proper for him to mention the intervening time,
because he would not be conscious of any such
time, and it would not seem to him on awaking
to life again that any such period had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly, Bishop Law lays down this general
principle on this question:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The Scriptures, in speaking of the connection between
our present and future being, do not take into the account
our <em>intermediate state in death</em>; no more than we, in describing
the course of any man’s actions, take into account
the time <em>he sleeps</em>. Therefore, the Scriptures (to be consistent
with themselves) <em>must affirm</em> an immediate connection
between death and the Judgment. Heb. 9:27; 2
Cor. 5:6, 8.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>John Crellius says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Because the time between death and the resurrection
is not to be reckoned, therefore the apostle might speak
thus, though the soul has no sense of anything after
death.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Priestly says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The apostle, considering his own situation, would
naturally connect the end of this life with the commencement
of another and a better, as he would have no perception
of any interval between them. That the apostle had
no view short of the coming of Christ to Judgment, is evident
from the phrase he makes use of, namely, <em>being with
Christ</em>, which can only take place at his second coming.
For Christ himself has said that he would come again,
and that he would take his disciples to himself, which
clearly implies that they were not to be with him before
that time.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>So in harmony with this reference to our Lord’s
teaching is the language used by Paul in 1 Thess.
4:16, 17, that we here refer to it again: “For the
Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with
the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall
rise first. Then we which are alive and remain
shall be caught up together with them in the
clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall
we ever be with the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Christ taught that the time when his people
were to be with him again was at his second
coming, so Paul here teaches. We call attention
to the word <em>so</em>, in the last sentence of the quotation.
So means in this way, in this manner, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>this means. “<em>So</em>,” in this manner, by this means,
“shall we ever be with the Lord.” When Paul,
as he does here, describes without any limitations,
the way and means by which we go to be with
the Lord, he precludes every other means. He
the same as says there is no other means by
which we can be with the Lord, and if there is
any other means of gaining this end, this language
is not true. If we go to be with the Lord,
by means of our immortal spirit, when we die,
we do not go to be with him by means of the
visible coming of Christ, the resurrection of the
dead, and the change of the living, and Paul’s
language is a stupendous falsehood. There is no
possible way of avoiding this conclusion, except
by claiming that the descent of the Lord from
Heaven, the mighty shout, the voice of the archangel,
the sounding of the great trump of God,
the resurrection of the dead, and the change of
the living, all take place when a person dies--a
position too absurd to be seriously refuted, and
almost too ridiculous to be even stated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shall we then take the position that Paul
taught the Philippians that a person went by his
immortal spirit immediately at death to be with
the Lord, when he had plainly told the Thessalonians
that this was to be brought about in altogether
a different manner, and by altogether different
means? No one who would have venerated
that holy apostle when alive, or who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>any decent regard for his memory now that he
is dead, will accuse him of so teaching.</p>

<p class='c011'>Why, then, does he say that he has a desire to
depart, that is, to die? Because he well understood
that his life of suffering, of toil, and trial
here was to terminate by death; and if the church
could spare him, he would gladly have it come,
not only to release him from his almost unbearable
burdens, but because he knew further that all
the intervening space between his death and the
return of his Lord would seem to him to be instantly
annihilated, and the glories of the eternal
world, through his resurrection from the dead,
would instantly open upon his view.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is objected again that Paul was very foolish
to express such a desire if he was not to be with
his Lord till the resurrection; for, in that case,
he would be with him no sooner if he died than
he would if he did not die. Those who make
this objection, either cannot have fully considered
this subject, or they utterly fail to comprehend it.
They have no difficulty in seeing how Paul would
be with Christ sooner by dying, provided his
spirit, when he died, immediately entered into
his presence; but they cannot see how it would
be so when the time between his death and the
coming of Christ is to him an utter blank, and
then without the consciousness on his part, that
a single instant has elapsed, he is ushered into
the presence of his Redeemer. Remember that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Paul’s consciousness was his only means of measuring
time; and if he had died just as he wrote
these words to the Philippians, it would have
been <em>to him</em> an entrance into Christ’s presence
just as much sooner as what time elapsed between
the penning of that sentence and the day of his
death. None can fail to see this point, if they
will consider it in the light of the fact we have
here tried so fully to set forth, that the dead have
no perceptions of passing time.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the light of the foregoing reasoning, let us
read and paraphrase this famous passage to the
Philippians:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“For to me to live is for the furtherance of the cause of
Christ, and for me to die is still gain to that cause (because
‘Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it
be by life or death,’ verse 20). But if I live in the flesh,
this, the furtherance of Christ’s cause, is the fruit of my
labor; but what course I should take were it left for me
to decide, I know not; for I am in a straight betwixt two:
I know that the church still needs my labors, but I have
a desire to end my mortal pilgrimage, and be the next instant,
so far as my experience goes (for the dead perceive
no passing of time), in the presence of my Lord. Consulting
my own feelings, this I should esteem far better; but
I know that it is more needful for you that I abide still
in a condition to labor on for your good in this mortal
state.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Who can say, bearing in mind the language
Paul frequently uses in his other epistles, that
this is not a just paraphrase of his language here.
The only objection against it is, that, so rendered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>it does not support the conscious-state dogma.
But it makes a harmony in all that Paul has
taught on the subject; and is it not far more desirable
to maintain the harmony of the sacred
writings, than to try to make them defend a
dogma which involves them in a fatal contradiction?</p>

<p class='c011'>REMAINING TEXTS CONSIDERED.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have now examined all the principal texts
of the Scriptures which are supposed to have a
bearing on the question of the intermediate state.
A few others of minor importance are occasionally
urged in favor of the popular view, and as
such are entitled to a passing notice. We give
them in consecutive order as follows:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>Rom. 8:38, 39. “For I am persuaded that neither
death, nor life, ... shall be able to separate us from
the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is claimed that death cannot separate us
from the love of God; but, as God cannot exercise
his love toward any but a rational and conscious
creature, therefore the soul must be
alive after death. (<cite>Immortality of the Soul,
by Luther Lee</cite>, p. 111.) To what far-fetched and
abortive reasoning will wrong theories lead intelligent
men. We owe the reader an apology for
noticing this passage at all. We should not here
introduce it, were it not used as an objection to
the view we advocate; and we should not believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>it could ever be urged as an objection, had
we not actually seen it. The reasoning of the
apostle has to be completely inverted before any
argument (may we be pardoned the misnomer)
can be manufactured out of it for the conscious-state
theory. For it is of our love to God, through
Christ, and not of his to us, that the apostle
speaks. It has reference, also, wholly to this life.
Thus he says, verse 35, “Who shall separate us
from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness,
or peril, or sword?” That is, shall these things
which we have to endure in this life on account
of our profession of the gospel and our love for
Christ, quench that love in any wise? Shall we
compromise the gospel, and alienate ourselves
from the love of Christ, who has done so much
for us, and through whom we hope for so much
(see the whole chapter), to avoid a little persecution,
peril, and distress? The separation from
the love of Christ by death, of which he speaks,
is the same as the separation by persecution, &amp;c.;
but tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness,
peril, and sword, do not necessarily kill
us; they have respect to this life; the separation,
therefore, is something which takes place here--simply
an alienation of our hearts from him.
And shall all these things, he asks--nay, more,
shall even the prospect of death on account of
our profession of Christ, prevent our loving and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>following him? No! is the implied and emphatic
answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such we believe to be the view which any one
must take of this passage, who does not find himself
under the <a id='corr212.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='unfortuate'>unfortunate</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_212.3'><ins class='correction' title='unfortuate'>unfortunate</ins></a></span> necessity of making out
a case.</p>

<p class='c011'>But looking at this scripture from the objector’s
stand-point, the singular inquiry at once
forces itself upon us, Can the immortal soul in
its disembodied state suffer tribulation, distress,
persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, and sword!?</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>2 Cor. 4:16. “For which cause we faint not; but
though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is
renewed day by day.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Is this inward man the immortal soul? We
answer, No; but the new man which we put on,
Christ formed within <em>the hope</em> of glory. See
Col. 3:9, 10; Eph. 4:22, 24; 3:16, 17; Col.
1:27.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>1 Thess. 4:14. “For if we believe that Jesus died
and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus
will God bring with him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Yes, says the objector, bring them from Heaven;
so they must now be with him there in a conscious
state. Not quite so fast. The text speaks
of those who sleep in Jesus. Do you believe those
who have gone to Heaven are asleep? We always
supposed that Heaven was a place of unceasing
activity, and of uninterrupted joy. And,
again, are all these persons going to be brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>from Heaven asleep! What a theological incongruity!
But, from what place are they brought,
if not from Heaven? The same place, we answer,
from which God brought our Lord Jesus
Christ. And what place was that? See Heb.
13:20: “Now the God of peace, that brought
again <em>from the dead</em> our Lord Jesus,” &amp;c.
We may then read the text in Thessalonians, as
follows: “For if we believe that Jesus died and
God brought him from the dead, even so them
also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
him from the dead.” Simply this the text affirms,
and nothing more. It is a glorious pledge of the
resurrection, and so far diametrically opposed to
the conscious-state theory.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>2 Tim. 4:6. “For I am now ready to be offered, and
the time of my departure is at hand.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is claimed that the departure here referred to
is death, with which we agree. We take no exceptions
to the remark so often made, “Departed
this life,” &amp;c. <a id='corr213.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Put'>But</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_213.21'><ins class='correction' title='Put'>But</ins></a></span> as Paul does not here intimate
that his departure was to be to Heaven, or
even to any conscious intermediate state, we
have no right to infer this.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>2 Pet. 1:14. “Knowing that shortly I must put off
this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath
showed me.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is here claimed that the “I” that speaks,
and the “my” that is in possession of a tabernacle,
is Peter’s soul, the man proper, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the tabernacle, is the body which he was going
to lay off. That Peter here has reference
to death, we doubt not; but it was to be
as the Lord Jesus Christ had showed him.
How had he shown him it would be? See
John 21:18, 19: “But when <em>thou</em> shalt be old,
<em>thou</em> shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another
shall gird <em>thee</em>, and carry thee whither thou
wouldest not. This spake he, signifying by
what death <em>he</em> should glorify God.” Here we
are shown that the “thou” and the “he,”
claimed on 1 Pet. 1:14, to be Peter’s soul, the
man proper, was going to die, and by death, glorify
God. And Peter himself says in the next
verse, “Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may
be able after <em>my</em> decease to have these things always
in remembrance.” Here, then, the same
“my,” Peter’s soul, the man proper, recollect,
which in the verse before is in the possessive
case, and governed by tabernacle, is again in
the possessive case, and governed by decease, or
<em>death</em>! Yes, Peter <em>himself</em> was going to die.
We find no proof of a double entity here.</p>

<p class='c011'>This phraseology is well illustrated by Job 7:21,
which shows that the man proper, the “I,”
sleeps in the dust: “And why dost Thou not
pardon my transgression, and take away mine
iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and
thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall
not be.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>2 Pet 2:9. “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the
godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto
the day of Judgment to be punished.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>This testimony shows that the unjust do not
enter into a place of punishment at death, but
are <em>reserved</em> to the day of Judgment. Where
are they reserved? Answer. In the general
receptacle of the dead, the grave. See Job
21:30.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>Rev. 20:5. “But the rest of the dead lived not
again until the thousand years were finished. This is
the first resurrection.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>By this first resurrection a portion of the
dead are restored to life, consciousness, and
activity, while it is said of those whose condition
is not affected by this resurrection, that
they <em>lived not</em> for a thousand years. This
proves that up to the time of this resurrection,
<em>all</em> the dead were in a condition just the opposite
of life--a condition in which it might
be said of them that they “lived not.” And
this, mark, is spoken of the whole conscious
being, not of the body merely. No language
could more positively show that in death the
whole person is in a state just the opposite of life.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>Rev. 22:8, 9. “And I John ... fell down to worship
before the feet of the angel which showed me these
things. Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not;
for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the
prophets.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>This text is supposed to prove that one of the
old prophets came to John as an angel, showing
that the dead exist in a conscious state. But it
does not so teach. The angel simply stated that he
was John’s fellow-servant, and the fellow-servant
of John’s brethren, the prophets, and the fellow-servant
of them which keep the sayings of this
book. The being of whom they were all worshipers
together was the great God. Therefore,
says the angel, do not worship me, since I am
only a worshiper with you at the throne of God;
but worship God. This angel had doubtless been
sent to the ancient prophets to reveal things to
them, as he had now come to John. Such we
believe to be the legitimate teaching of this
scripture, the last that is found in the book of
God supposed to teach a conscious state.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXV. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE DEATH OF ADAM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The inquirer into the nature of man, and his
condition in death, must ever turn with the
deepest interest to the record left us concerning
the father of our race. In Adam we have an
account of the origin of the human family, at
once so simple and consistent that the jeers of
skepticism fall harmless at its feet, and science,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>in comparison, only makes itself ridiculous, in
trying to account for it in any other manner.
And in the sentence pronounced upon him when
he fell under the fearful guilt of transgression, we
are shown to what condition death was designed
to reduce the human family. In the creation and
death of Adam, we have the account of the building
up and the unbuilding of a human being;
and this case, being the first and most illustrious,
must furnish the precedent and establish the rule
for the whole race.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the creation of Adam and the elements of
which he was composed, we have already spoken.
The record brings to view a formation made
wholly of the dust of the ground. “And the
Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground.”
This body was endowed with a high and perfect
organization, and was quickened into life by the
breath which the Lord breathed into its nostrils.
The body, before it was made alive, had no power
to act; the breath which was breathed into it
could not of itself act; but the body being quickened,
the machinery set in motion by this vital
principle, all the phenomena of physical life and
mental action at once resulted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Author of this noblest of creative works,
who must of necessity, as the ruler over all, require
the creatures of his hand to obey him, and
toward whom an exercise of love, and a voluntary
and willing submission, can alone constitute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>obedience, placed the man whom he had formed,
as was meet, upon a state of probation, to test
his loyalty to his Maker. The scene of his trial
was the beautiful garden in which was everything
that was pleasant to the sight and good for food;
and over all that adorned or enriched his Eden
home, with one exception, he had unlimited control.
The condition upon which he was to be
tested is thus definitely expressed:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of
every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat. But of
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not
eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Adam and Eve could not mistake the requirement
of this law, nor fail to understand the intent
of the penalty. And before Satan could
cause his temptation to make any impression on
the mind of Eve, he had to contradict this threatening,
assuring her that they should not surely
die. A question of veracity was thus raised between
God and Satan; and strange to say, the
theological world, in interpreting the penalty,
have virtually, with the exception of a small minority,
sided with Satan. This is seen in the interpretation
which is commonly put on this penalty,
making it consist of three divisions: 1.
Alienation of the soul from God, the love of sin,
and the hatred of holiness, called spiritual death.
2. The separation of soul and body, called temporal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>death. 3. Immediately after temporal death,
the conscious torment of the soul in hell, which
is to have no end, and is called eternal death.
The Baptist Confession of Faith, Art. 5, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“We believe that God made man upright; but he, sinning,
involved himself and posterity in death spiritual,
temporal, and eternal; from all which there is no deliverance
but by Christ.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Let us look at the different installments of this
penalty, and see if they will harmonize with the
language in which the original threatening is expressed:
“Thou shalt surely die.” Adam incurred
the penalty by sinning. After he had sinned,
he was a sinner. But a state of sin is that state
of alienation from God which the orthodox school
make to be a part of the penalty of his transgression.
In this they take as the <em>punishment</em>
of sin that which was simply its <em>result</em>; and
they make the sentence read, virtually, in this
profoundly sensible manner: “In the day that
thou sinnest, thou shalt surely be a sinner!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Because he wickedly became a sinner, and
brought himself into a state of alienation from
God, the doom was pronounced upon him, “Thou
shalt surely die.” Could this mean eternal death?
If so, Adam never could have been released therefrom.
But he is to be released from it; for “in
Christ shall all be made alive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These two installments, then, spiritual and
eternal death, utterly fail us, when brought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the test of the language in which the sentence is
expressed: one is nonsense, and the other an impossibility.</p>

<p class='c011'>Temporal death alone remains to be considered;
but the interpretation which is given to this, completely
nullifies the penalty, and makes Satan to
have been correct when he said, “Thou shalt not
surely die.” Temporal death is interpreted to
mean the separation of the soul from the body,
the body alone to die, but the soul, which is called
the real, responsible man, to enter upon an enlarged
and higher life. In this case, there is no
death; and the sentence should have read, In the
day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt be freed from
the clog of this mortal body, and enter upon a
new and eternal life. So said Satan, “Ye shall
be as gods;” and true to this assertion from the
father of lies, the heathen have all along deified
their dead men, and worshiped their departed
heroes; and modern poets have sung, “There is
no death; what seems so is transition.” If ever
the skill of a deceiver and the gullibility of a
victim were manifested in an unaccountable degree,
it is in this fact, that right in the face and
eyes of the pale throng that daily passes down
through the gate of death, the devil can make
men believe that after all his first lie was true,
and there is no such thing as death.</p>

<p class='c011'>From these considerations, it is evident that
nothing will meet the demands of the sentence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>but the cessation of the life of the whole man.
But that, says one, cannot be, for he was to die
in the very day he ate of the forbidden fruit;
but he did not literally die for nine hundred and
thirty years. If this is an objection against the
view we advocate, it is equally such against every
other. Take the threefold penalty above noticed.
If death spiritual, death temporal, and death
eternal, was the penalty, how much was fulfilled
on the day he sinned? Not death eternal, surely,
and not death temporal, which did not take place
for nine hundred and thirty years, but only death
spiritual. But this was only the first installment
of the penalty, and far less important than the
other two. The most that the friends of this interpretation
can say, therefore, is that the penalty
begun on that very day to be fulfilled. But
we can say as much with our view. “Dying,
thou shalt die,” reads the margin; which some
understand to mean, thou shalt inherit a mortal
nature, and the process of decay shall commence.
As soon as he sinned, he came under
the sentence of death, and the work commenced.
He bore up against the encroachments
of dissolution for nine hundred and thirty
years, and then the work was fully accomplished.</p>

<p class='c011'>When God proceeded to pronounce sentence
upon Adam, he gave us an authoritative interpretation
of the penalty from which there is no
appeal. Gen. 3:19: “In the sweat of thy face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the
ground; for out of it wast thou taken: <em>for dust
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The return to dust is here made a subsequent
event, to be preceded by a period of wearing
toil. And being finally overcome by the labors
and ills of life, the person addressed was to return
again to the dust from which he was taken.
With Adam, this process commenced on the
very day he transgressed, and the penalty
threatened, which covered all this work from
beginning to end, was executed in full when this
process was fully completed in Adam’s death,
nine hundred and thirty years thereafter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two things are connected together in the penalty
affixed to Adam’s disobedience. These are
the words, day and die: In the <em>day</em> thou eatest,
thou shalt <em>die</em>. The dying, whatever view we
take of it, must include temporal or literal death.
But this was not accomplished on that very day.
Therefore, to find a death which was inflicted on
that literal day, a figurative sense is given to the
word die, and it is claimed that a spiritual death
was that day wrought upon Adam. But we inquire,
If either of these terms, day or die, are to
be taken figuratively, why not let the dying be
literal, and the day be figurative, especially since
the sentence which God pronounced upon Adam,
when he came up for trial, shows that literal
death, and that only, was intended in the penalty?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>The use of the word day in such a sense,
meaning an indefinite period of time, is of frequent
occurrence in the Scriptures. An instance
in point occurs in 1 Kings 2:36-46. King Solomon
bound Shimei by an oath to remain in Jerusalem,
under the sentence that on the day he
went out in any direction, he should be slain.
After three years, two of his servants ran away
to Gath, and he went after them. It was then
told Solomon that Shimei had been to Gath and
returned. Solomon sent for him, reminded him
of the conditions on which his life was suspended,
and the oath he had broken, and then commanded
the executioner to put him to death.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gath was some twenty-five miles from Jerusalem.
That Shimei could go there and get his
servants, return, be sent for by Solomon, and be
tried and executed, all on the same day, is a supposition
by no means probable, even if it is possible.
Yet in his death the sentence was fulfilled,
that on the day he went out he should be slain.
Because on the very day he passed out of the
city, the only condition that held back the execution
of the sentence was removed, and he was
virtually a dead man.</p>

<p class='c011'>So with Adam. He was immediately cut off
from the tree of life, his source of physical vitality.
So much was executed on that very day.
Death was then his inevitable portion, to be
accomplished within the limits of that period
covered by the word, day.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>We are very well aware of the method adopted
to evade the conclusion which naturally follows
from the language of the sentence in Gen. 3:19.
This, it is claimed, was spoken only of the body,
not of the soul. The poetry of Longfellow,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dust thou art, to dust returnest,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Was not spoken of the soul,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>takes much better with most people than the
plain language of inspiration itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>To whom, then, or to what, was this sentence
addressed, “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
thou return”? Admitting that there is such a
creature of the imagination as the popular, independent,
immortal soul, was the language addressed
to that or to the body? If there is such
a soul as this, what does it constitute, on the
authority of the friends of that theory, themselves?
It is the real, responsible, intelligent
man. Watson says, “It is the soul <em>only</em> which
perceives pain or pleasure, which suffers or enjoys;”
and D. D. Whedon says, “It is the soul
that hears, feels, tastes, and smells, through its
sensorial organs.” The sentence, then, would be
addressed to that which could hear; the penalty
would be pronounced upon that which could feel.
The body, in the common view, is only an irresponsible
instrument, the means by which the
soul acts. It can, of itself, neither see, hear, feel,
will, or act. Who then will have the hardihood
to assert that God addressed his sentence to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>irresponsible instrument, the body merely? This
would be the same as for the judge in a criminal
court to proceed deliberately to address the
knife with which the murderer had taken the
life of his victim, and pronounce sentence upon
that, instead of the murderer himself. Away
with a view which offers to the Majesty of
Heaven the insult of representing that he acts in
this way!</p>

<p class='c011'>In the sentence, the personal pronoun, <em>thy</em>, is
once, and the personal pronoun, <em>thou</em>, is five
times, applied to the Adam whom God addressed.
“In the sweat of <em>thy</em> face, shalt <em>thou</em> eat bread,
till <em>thou</em> return unto the ground; for out of it
wast <em>thou</em> taken: for dust <em>thou</em> art, and unto
dust shalt <em>thou</em> return.” When we address our
fellowmen by the different personal pronouns of
our language, what do we address? The conscious,
intelligent, responsible man, that which
sees, feels, hears, thinks, acts, and is morally accountable.
But this, in popular parlance, is the
soul; these pronouns must every time stand for
the soul. The pronouns thy and thou, in Gen.
3:19, must then mean Adam’s soul. If they do
not mean it here, how does the same pronoun,
thou, in Luke 23:43, mean the thief’s soul,
when Christ said to him, “This day shalt <em>thou</em>
be with me in paradise”? or the <em>I</em> and <em>my</em> in 2
Pet. 1:14, refer to Peter’s soul, as we are told
they do, when he says, “Knowing that shortly I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>must put off this my tabernacle.” Our friends
must be consistent and uniform in their interpretations.
If in these instances the pronouns
do not refer to the soul, then these strong proof-texts,
to which the immaterialist always appeals,
are abandoned: if they do here refer to the soul,
they must likewise in Gen. 3:19, refer to the
soul. In that language, then, God addresses
Adam’s soul; and we have the authority of
Jehovah himself, the Creator of man, against
whose sentence, and the sunlight of whose word,
it does not become puny mortals to oppose their
shallow dictums, and the rushlight of human
reason, that man’s soul is wholly mortal, and that
in the dissolution of death it goes back to dust
again! There is no avoiding this conclusion;
and it forever settles the question of man’s condition
in death. It shows that the intermediate
state must be one in which the conscious man
has lost his consciousness, the intelligent man
his intelligence, the responsible man his responsibility,
and in which all the powers of his being,
mental, emotional, and physical, have ceased to act.</p>

<p class='c011'>No further argument need be introduced to
show that the Adamic penalty was literal death,
and that it reduced the whole man to a condition
of unconsciousness and decay. But a few
additional considerations will show that the popular
view is cumbered with absurdities on every
hand so plain that they should have proved their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>own antidote, and saved the doctors of theology
from the preposterous definitions they have attached
to death.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have the authority of Paul for stating that
through Christ we are released from all the penalty
which the race has incurred through Adam’s
transgression. “As in Adam all die, so in Christ
shall all be made alive.” If the death in which
we are involved through Adam is death spiritual,
temporal, and eternal, then all the race is redeemed
from these through Christ, and Universalism
is the result.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, Christ tasted death for every man. He
hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
made a curse for us. That is, Christ died
the same death for us which was introduced into
the world by Adam’s sin. Was this death eternal?
If so, the Saviour is gone, and the plan of
salvation can never be carried into effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Rom. 5:12-14, occurs this remarkable passage:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world,
and <em>death</em> by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for
that all have sinned: (For until the law sin was in the
world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even
over them that had not sinned after the similitude of
Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of Him that was
to come.)”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>In the first part of the verse Paul speaks of
the death that came in by Adam’s sin, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>says that it reigned from Adam to Moses over
them that had not sinned. From this language,
accepting the popular interpretation of the Adamic
penalty, we must come to the intolerable
conclusion that personally sinless beings from
Adam to Moses were consigned to eternal misery!
From such a sentiment, every fiber of our
humanity recoils with horror. We cannot stifle
the feeling that it is an outrage upon the character
of God, and therefore cannot be true. The
death threatened Adam was literal death, not
eternal life in misery.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the view that the Adamic penalty was simply
literal death, many eminent men have given
their unqualified adhesion.</p>

<p class='c011'>John Locke (<cite>Reasonableness of Christianity</cite>,
s. 1,) says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“By reason of Adam’s transgression all men are mortal
and come to die.... It seems a strange way of
understanding a law which requires the plainest and
directest words, that by death should be meant eternal
life in misery.... I confess that by death, here, I can
understand nothing but a ceasing to be, the losing of all
actions of life and sense. Such a death came upon Adam
and all his posterity, by his first disobedience in paradise,
under which death they should have lain forever had it
not been for the redemption by Jesus Christ.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Isaac Watts (<cite>Ruin and Recovery of Mankind</cite>,
s. 3), though he was a believer in the immortality
of the soul, has the candor to say:--</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“There is not one place of Scripture that occurs to
me, where the word death as it was threatened in the
law of innocency, necessarily signifies a certain miserable
immortality of the soul, either to Adam, the actual sinner,
or to his posterity.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Taylor says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Death was to be the consequence of his [Adam’s] disobedience,
and the death here threatened can be opposed
only to that life God gave Adam when he created him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>With two more considerations we close this
chapter:--</p>

<p class='c011'>1. Adam was on probation. Life and death
were set before him. “In the day that thou
eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die,” said God.
The only promise of life he had in case of disobedience
came from one whom it is not very flattering
to the advocates of a natural immortality
to call the first propounder and natural ally of
their system. But had Adam been endowed with
a natural immortality, it could not have been
suspended on his obedience. But it was so suspended,
as we learn from the first pages of revelation.
It was, therefore, not absolute, but contingent.
Immortal he might become by obedience
to God; disobeying, he was to die. He did
disobey, and was driven from the garden. “And
now,” said God, “lest he put forth his hand, and
take also of the tree of life, and eat, and <em>live forever</em>;”--therefore,
the cherubim and flaming sword
were placed to exclude forever his approach to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>the life-giving tree. Quite the reverse of an uncontingent
immortality is certainly brought to
view here. Adam could bequeath to his posterity
no higher nature than he himself possessed.
The stream, that commencing just outside the garden
of Eden, has flowed down through the lapse
of six thousand years, has certainly never risen
higher than the fountain head; and we may be
sure we possess no superior endowments in this
respect to those of Adam.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. The second consideration under this head is,
the exhortations we have in the word of God to
<em>seek</em> for immortality, if we would obtain it. “Seek
the Lord, and ye shall live,” is his declaration to
the house of Israel. Amos 5:4, 6. “The wages
of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Rom. 6:23.
Gift to whom? To every man, irrespective of
character? By no means; but gift <em>through</em>
Christ, to them only who are his. Again, “To
them who by patient continuance in well-doing
<em>seek</em> for glory, honor, and immortality [God will
render], eternal life.” Rom. 2:7. Varying the
language of the apostle a little, we may here inquire,
What a man <em>hath</em>, why doth he yet seek
for? The propriety of seeking for that which
we already have, is something in regard to which
it yet remains that we be enlightened by the advocates
of the dominant theology.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVI. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE RESURRECTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As clearly as the human race have been taught
by the experience of six thousand years that
death is their common lot, so clearly are we
taught by the word of God, and by some notable
exhibitions of divine power, that all who
have gone into their graves shall come forth
again to life.</p>

<p class='c011'>The words in the New Testament which express
this fact are <em>anastasis</em>, <em>egersis</em>, and <em>exanastasis</em>.
The two latter occur but once each, the
first in reference to the resurrection of Christ, in
Matt. 27:53, the last in Phil. 3:11, where Paul
expresses a desire to attain to a resurrection out
from among the dead. <em>Anastasis</em> occurs forty-two
times, being the word which is invariably
used in the New Testament, with the exceptions
just named, to express the resurrection. This
word is defined by Robinson to mean, literally, <em>a
rising up</em>, as of walls, of a suppliant, or from a
seat. Specially in the New Testament, the resurrection
of the body from death, the return of
the dead body to life, as, first of individuals who
have returned to life on earth, Heb. 11:35; secondly,
of the future and general resurrection at
the end of all things, John 11:24. It is often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>joined to the word, dead; as in the expression,
the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>From these well-established meanings of the
word it is evident that that which goes down
will rise again. That which goes into the grave
will come up again out of the grave. The rising
again of the body is certainly assured by this
word, and the manner in which it is used. This
resurrection is a future event: “The hour is coming,
in the which all that are in the graves shall
hear His voice, and shall come forth.” John 5:28,
29. Paul said, when disputing with Tertullus
before the governor, I “have hope toward
God, which they themselves also allow, that there
shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the
just and the unjust.” Acts 24:15. And he tells
us in chapter 26:7, that unto that promise the
twelve tribes hope to come.</p>

<p class='c011'>If, then, this is a firmly-established fact, that
God is to make such a mighty manifestation of
his power as to re-animate the scattered dust of
those whom the grave has consumed from time’s
earliest morn, there must be some cause for such
an action. This great event has a tremendous
bearing on the question of the intermediate
state, and all views of that state must be adjusted
to harmonize therewith. If any view is
entertained which virtually renders such an event
unnecessary, it must be shown that the resurrection
as here defined is not taught in the word of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>God, or it must be admitted that the doctrine
which nullifies it, is unscriptural.</p>

<p class='c011'>The important inquiry now arises respecting
the popular view, If the real being, the intelligent,
responsible entity, ceases not its life and
consciousness at death, but continues on in a
more enlarged and perfect sphere of existence and
activity, what need is there of the resurrection of
the body? If the body is but a trammel, a clog
to the operations of the soul, what need that it
should come back and gather up its scattered
particles from the silent tomb, and re-fetter itself
with this material robe?</p>

<p class='c011'>Wm. Tyndale, defending the doctrine of Martin
Luther, that the dead sleep, addressed to his
opponent the same pungent inquiry. He said:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“And ye, in putting them [departed souls] in Heaven,
hell, and purgatory, destroy the argument wherewith
Christ and Paul prove the resurrection.... If the
souls be in Heaven, tell me why they be not in as good
case as the angels be? and then what cause is there of
the resurrection?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Andrew Carmichael (<cite>Theology of Scripture</cite>,
vol. ii., p. 315) says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“It cannot be too often repeated: <em>If there be an immortal
soul there is no resurrection; and if there be any resurrection
there is no immortal soul</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Muller (<cite>Ch. Doc. of Sin</cite>, p. 318) says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The Christian faith in immortality is indissolubly connected
with a promise of a future resurrection of the
dead.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>We now propose to show that the resurrection
is a prominent doctrine of the Bible; and if this
can be established, it follows, upon the judgment
of these eminent men, that the immortality of
the soul cannot be true. We need not stop to
notice that impalpable and groundless theory
which makes the resurrection take place immediately
at death, by supposing it to be the rising
of the soul from the earthly house of this tabernacle,
and its entering at once into its spiritual
house, this to be inhabited, and the former, abandoned,
forever. For in this case there is no resurrection;
since the soul lives right on, and does
not die at all. The resurrection which the Bible
brings to view is a resurrection of <em>the dead</em>. It
cannot be applied to anything that continuously
lives, however many changes it may pass through.
A person must go down into a state of death before
he can be raised from the dead. Hence this
theory is no resurrection at all, and so is at war
with all the Bible says about the resurrection of
the dead. Moreover, it is utterly impossible to
harmonize this with the many references to the
general resurrection at the end of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>We return to the Bible doctrine of the resurrection
of the dead, the literal resurrection and
resuscitation of our natural bodies, and affirm that
the Bible makes this resurrection necessary, by
representing the dead to be in such a condition
that without this event they can have no future
existence.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>1. Death is compared to sleep. There must,
then, be some analogy between a state of sleep
and a state of death, and this analogy must pertain
to that which renders sleep a peculiar condition.
Our condition in sleep differs from our
condition when awake, simply in this, that when
we are soundly asleep we are entirely <em>unconscious</em>.
In this respect, then, death is like sleep;
that is, the dead are unconscious. This figure is
frequently used to represent the condition of the
dead. Dan. 12:2: “Many of them that <em>sleep</em> in
the dust of the earth shall awake.” Matt. 27:52:
“Many bodies of the saints which <em>slept</em>
arose.” Acts 7:60: After Stephen had beheld
the vision of Christ and was stoned to death, the
record says, he “fell <em>asleep</em>.” In 1 Cor. 15:20,
Christ is called the first-fruits of them that <em>slept</em>;
and in verse 57, Paul says, “We shall not all
<em>sleep</em>.” Again Paul writes to the Thessalonians,
1 Thess. 4:13, 14, that he would not have them
ignorant concerning them which are <em>asleep</em>. In
verse 14, he speaks of them as <em>asleep</em> in Jesus,
and explains what he means, in verse 16, by calling
them “dead in Christ.” And the advocates
of the conscious state cannot dispose of these expressions
by saying that they apply to the body
merely; for they do not hold that the consciousness
which we have in life (which is what we
lose in death) pertains to the body merely. Job
plainly declares that they will not awake till the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>resurrection, at the last day. “Man dieth and
wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost,
and where is he? As the waters fail from the
sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man
lieth down and riseth not: till the heavens be no
more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of
their sleep.” If, therefore, there is no resurrection,
these dead are destined to sleep in unconsciousness
forever.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. The dead are in a condition as though they
had not been. So Job testifies; for he affirms
that if he could have died in earliest infancy, like
a hidden, untimely birth, he would not have been;
and in this respect he declared he would have
been like kings, counsellors, and princes of the
earth who built costly tombs in which to enshrine
their bodies when dead. To that condition he
applies the expression which has since been so
often quoted, “There the wicked cease from
troubling, and there the weary be at rest.” Job
3:11-18. If, then, a person when dead is as
though he had not been, without a resurrection to
release him from this state, he will never be, or
exist, again.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. The dead have no knowledge. Speaking of
the dead man, Job says (14:21), “His sons come
to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are
brought low, and he perceiveth it not of them.”
Ps. 146:4. “His breath goeth forth, he returneth
to his earth; in that very day his thoughts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>perish.” Solomon was inspired to speak to the
same effect as his father David: Eccl. 9:5, 6:
“For the living know that they shall die, but the
dead know not anything.... Also their love,
and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;
neither have they any more a portion forever in
anything that is done under the sun.” Verse 10:
“There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge,
nor wisdom, in the grave whither thou goest.”
Evidence like this can neither be mistaken nor
evaded. It is vain for the immaterialist to claim
that it applies to the body in distinction from an
immortal soul; for they do not hold that the
thoughts (διαλογισμός, <em>thought, reasoning</em>,) which
David says perish in death, belong to the body,
but to the soul. And according to Solomon, that
which knows when the man is living, does not
know when he is dead. Without a resurrection,
therefore, the dead will forever remain without
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. The dead are not in Heaven nor in hell, but
in the dust of the earth. Job 17:13-16: “If I
wait, the grave is mine house.” In chap. 14:14,
he said, “All the days of my appointed time will
I wait, till my change come.” The change referred
to, must therefore be the resurrection, and
he describes his condition till that time, in the
following language: “I have made my bed in
the darkness. I have said to corruption, Thou
art my father; to the worm, Thou art my mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>and my sister, ... when <em>our rest together is in
the dust</em>.” Isa. 26:19: “Thy dead men shall
live; together with my dead body shall they arise.
Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust; for thy
dew is as the dew of herbs; and the earth shall
cast out the dead.” Is it possible that the phraseology
of this text can be misunderstood? It
speaks of the living again of dead men, of the
arising of dead bodies, and of the earth’s casting
out the dead. And the command is addressed to
them thus: “Awake and sing.” Who? Ye who
are still conscious, basking in the bliss of Heaven
and chanting the high praises of God? No; but,
“Ye who dwell <em>in dust</em>;” ye who are in your
graves. If the dead are conscious, Isaiah talked
nonsense. If we believe his testimony we must
look into the graves for the dead; and if there is
no resurrection, there they will forever lie mingled
with the clods of the valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. The dead, even the most holy and righteous,
have no remembrance of God, and cannot, while
in that condition, render him any praise and
thanksgiving. Ps. 6:5: “For in death there is
no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall
give thee thanks?” Ps. 115:17: “The dead
praise not the Lord, neither any that go down
into silence.” Good King Hezekiah, when praising
the Lord for adding to his days fifteen years,
gives this as the reason why he thus rejoiced:
Isa. 38:18, 19: “For the grave cannot praise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>thee, death cannot celebrate thee; they that go
down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
The <em>living</em>, the <em>living</em>, he shall praise thee, as I
do this day; the father to the children shall
make known thy truth.” Modern doctors of divinity
have Hezekiah in Heaven praising God.
He declared that when he was dead he could not
do this. Whose testimony is the more worthy
of credit, that of the inspired king of Israel, or
that of the theologians of subsequent ages of error
and confusion? If we can believe Hezekiah,
unless there is to be a resurrection, the righteous
dead are never more to praise their Maker.</p>

<p class='c011'>6. The dead, even the righteous, are not ascended
to the Heavens. So Peter testifies respecting
the patriarch David: Acts 2:29, 34, 35: “Men and
brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
David, that he is both dead and buried, and
his sepulcher is with us unto this day. For David
is not ascended into the Heavens: but he saith
himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on
my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool.”
We call the especial attention of the
reader to the whole argument presented by Peter,
beginning with verse 24. Peter undertakes
to prove from a prophecy recorded in the Psalms,
the resurrection of Christ. He says, verse 31,
“He, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection
of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell
[<em>hades</em>, the grave], neither did his flesh see corruption.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>And how does he prove that David
speaks of Christ, and not of himself? He proves
it from the fact that David’s soul <em>was</em> left in
<em>hades</em> and his flesh did see corruption; and his
sepulcher was with them to that day. For David,
he says, has not ascended into the Heavens.
Now if David’s soul did live right on in consciousness;
if it was not left in <em>hades</em>, no man can
show that David, in that psalm, did not speak of
himself instead of Christ; and then Peter’s argument
for the resurrection of Christ would be entirely
destroyed. But Peter, especially when
speaking as he was on this occasion under the
influence of the Holy Ghost, knew how to reason;
and his argument entirely destroys the
dogma of the immortality of the soul. But if
David has not yet ascended into the Heavens,
how is he ever to get there? There is no other
way but by a resurrection of the dead. So he
himself says, Ps. 17:15: “I shall be satisfied
when I awake [from the sleep of death], with
Thy likeness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>7. And finally, Paul, in his masterly argument
in 1 Cor. 15, states explicitly the conclusion
which is necessary from every one of the texts
which we have quoted, that if there is no resurrection,
then all the dead, even those who have
fallen asleep in Christ, are perished. Verses 16-18.
“For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ
raised. And if Christ be not raised, your faith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>is vain; ye are yet in your sins. <em>Then they also
which are fallen asleep in Christ are</em> <span class='fss'>PERISHED</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As we read this testimony, we pause in utter
amazement that any who profess to believe the
Bible should cling with tenacity to the doctrine
of the immortality of the soul which so directly
contradicts it. If the souls of the dead live right
on, are they perished? What! perished? and
yet living in a larger sphere? Perished? and
yet enjoying the attendant blessings of everlasting
life in Heaven? Perished? and yet at God’s
right hand where there is fullness of joy, and
pleasures forevermore? Perish, amid the ruins
of the heathen mythology from which it springs,
that theory which thus lifts its dead men on
high, contrary to the teachings of the word of
God!</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul speaks of the whole being. As in Adam
we die, so in Christ shall we be made alive. Is
it conceivable that Paul drops out of sight the
real man, the soul which soars away to realms
of light, and frames all this argument, and talks
thus seriously about the cast-off shell, the body,
merely? The idea is preposterous to the last
degree.</p>

<p class='c011'>After stating that if there is no resurrection we
perish, he assures us that Christ is risen and that
there is a resurrection for all; then he takes up
the resurrection of those who sleep in Christ, and
tells us when that resurrection shall be. It is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>take place, not by the rising from this mortal
coil of an ethereal, immaterial essence when we
die, but it is to be at the great day when the last
trump shall shatter this decrepid earth from center
to circumference.</p>

<p class='c011'>The testimony on this point is well summed
up by Bishop Law, who speaks as follows:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“I proceed to consider what account the Scriptures
give of that state to which death reduces us. And this
we find represented by <em>sleep</em>; by a negation of all <em>life</em>,
<em>thought</em>, or <em>action</em>; by <em>rest</em>, <em>resting-place</em>, or <em>home</em>, <em>silence</em>,
<em>oblivion</em>, <em>darkness</em>, <em>destruction</em>, or <em>corruption</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>This representation is abundantly sustained
by the Scriptures referred to; and by all these
the great fact is inscribed in indelible characters
over the portals of the dark valley, that our existence
is not perpetuated by means of an immortal
soul, but that without a resurrection from the
dead, there is no future life.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it is objected that, from our standpoint of
the unconsciousness of the dead, a resurrection is
impossible; for if a person ever ceases to exist as
a conscious being, the re-organization of the matter
of which he was composed would be a new
creation, but not a resurrection. It is sufficient
to say in reply that continued consciousness is
not necessary to preserve identity of being. This
is proved by nearly every member of the human
family every day. Did the reader ever enjoy a
period of sound, unconscious sleep? If so, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>he awoke, how did he know that he was the
same individual he was before? How does any
one know, after a good night’s sleep, that he is
the same person that retired to rest the night before?
Simply because his organization is the
same on awaking that it was when he became
unconscious in sleep. Now suppose that during
this period of unconsciousness, while the soul itself,
if there is in man such a distinct entity as is
claimed, is also unconscious, the body of a person
could be cut up into innumerable fragments, the
bones ground to powder, the flesh dissolved in
acids, and the entire being, soul and all, destroyed.
After remaining in this condition a little
time, suppose all those particles could be put
back again substantially as they were before, the
general arrangement of the matter, especially of
the brain, the organ of the mind being identically
what it was; and then suppose that life
could be imparted to it again, and the person be
allowed to sleep on till morning; when he woke,
would he be conscious of any break in the line of
his existence? Any one must see that he would
not. Being organized just as before, his mind
would resume its consciousness just as if nothing
had happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>So with the dissolution of death. After its
period of unconsciousness is passed over, in the
resurrection the particles of the body are reunited,
re-organized, and re-arranged, essentially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>as they were at the moment of death, and reanimated;
then the line of life is taken up, and
the current of thought resumed just where it was
laid down in death, it matters not how many
thousands of years before. This, the power of
God can do; and to deny this is to “err, not
knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.”
In this way, we can have a true and proper resurrection,
a living again of the whole person, as
the Bible affirms. On the supposition of continued
consciousness, this is impossible; for in
this case the real man lives right on, the body,
which the Bible makes of so much importance,
being only the garment with which it was temporarily
clothed; and in this case the resuscitation
of the body would not and could not be the
resurrection of the man. The popular view
makes the Bible as inconsistent on the subject of
man, as it would be for a historian to give the
history of some celebrated man’s coat, and call it
the history of the man himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then it is further objected that if persons come
up in the resurrection as they went down in death,
we should have a motley group, bloated with
dropsy, emaciated with consumption, scabbed,
scarred, ulcered, maimed and deformed; which
would be both unreasonable and disgusting. And
this, it is claimed, is a necessary consequence from
the view that the same matter is raised that went
into the grave, and so far re-organized according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>to its previous arrangement as to constitute identity
of being. But when we speak of the re-arrangement
of the particles of the body, is it not
evident to all that there are fortuitous and abnormal
conditions which are not to be taken at
all into the account? and that the essential and
elemental parts are only to be understood? Who
would imagine that the body might not differ in
the resurrection from what it was before, as much
at least as it differs at one period in its earthly
history from its condition at another, and yet its
identity be preserved? But we are sometimes
in health, sometimes in sickness, sometimes in
flesh, and sometimes wasted away, sometimes
with diseased members, and sometimes entirely
free from disease; and in all these changes we
are conscious that we have the same body.
Why? Because its essential elements remain,
and its organization is continued. Whatever
change can take place in our bodies during our
earth life, and our identity be continued, changed
to the same degree may be the body when raised
from the dead, and yet it be the same body. But
a missing member might be instantly replaced, a
diseased limb healed, the consumptive restored to
the bloom of health, or the body, swollen with
dropsy, reduced to its natural size, and the individual
still be conscious that he was the same
person.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is said still further by way of objection, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the matter of one body, after being decomposed
by death, is absorbed and taken into other bodies,
and becomes constituent parts of them; so that
at the resurrection the same matter may have belonged
to several different bodies, and cannot be
restored to them all; therefore the doctrine of
the resurrection of the body is unphilosophical.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the reader will take the trouble to submit
this objection to a little intelligent scrutiny, he
will find it to grow rapidly and beautifully less,
until finally it vanishes entirely away. Let us
take the extremest case supposable: that of the
cannibal who might possibly (though this would
not naturally be the case), make an entire meal
of human flesh. We cannot admit the statement
of a certain minister who, in his zeal to make this
objection appear very strong, claimed that a cannibal
might have the whole body of his victim
within his own at the same time. For this supposes
that he would eat a whole man at one
meal, and, further, that he would consume the
viscera, skull, bones, brains, and all. But it is
hardly supposable that, cannibals though they
are, they have such an enormous capacity, or are
such unpardonable eaters.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless, let us suppose that a cannibal
would, in process of time, consume an entire victim;
what proportion could he use in this way?
Not one-half, by weight. And what proportion
of this would be taken up by the body and become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>incorporated with it? But a small fraction.
And to what parts would this naturally go?
To those grosser and unessential parts which
most rapidly change, and demand the most constant
supply. But while a few pounds of matter
are supplied to the body, if that body maintains
a uniform condition, an equal amount of matter
has been thrown off. Thus it will be seen that at
no one time is it possible for any material amount
of one body to be a part of another. But if
there was danger, in these rare cases, that an essential
element of one body would become a constituent
part of another, and so remain, could not
the providence of God easily interpose to prevent
this, by giving these particles another direction?
Most assuredly it could. And this is not beneath
His care who numbers all the hairs of our heads,
and without whose notice not a sparrow falls to
the ground. This objection not only betrays an
utter lack of faith in God’s power and care in
such matters, but philosophically considered, it
amounts simply to a cavil.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is the resurrection of the body of which the
Bible treats. It knows no other. In 1 Cor. 15:35,
36, Paul asserts an obvious fact, that nothing
can be quickened (revived or resuscitated, as
from death, or an inanimate state--<cite>Webster</cite>,) except
it first die. To talk of a quickening or making
alive of that which does not die, or of a resurrection
from the dead of that which does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>go down into death, is richly deserving of the epithet
which Paul there applies to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And what is it that shall be quickened in the
resurrection? The holy and infallible word of
God replies, <em>This mortal body</em>. Rom. 8:11:
“But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus
Christ from the dead dwell in you, he that raised
up Christ from the dead shall also <em>quicken your
mortal bodies</em> by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”
Again, in verse 23, Paul says: “Even we ourselves
groan within ourselves, waiting for the
adoption, to wit, the <em>redemption of our body</em>.”
And in 1 Cor. 15, Paul is as explicit as he well
can be on this subject. Verse 44: “It is sown a
natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.” What
does he mean by the natural body, and by its
being sown? He means the burial of our present
bodies in the grave. So he says in verses 42,
43: “So also is the resurrection of the dead. It
is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory:
it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it
is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual
body.” What is sown? The natural body. Then
what is raised? The very same thing. IT is
sown; IT is raised; raised in incorruption, in
glory, in power, a spiritual body. Raised in this
manner, the natural body becomes a spiritual
body. Why? Because the Spirit of Him that
raised up Christ quickens, resuscitates, or makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>it alive again, as Paul wrote to the Romans.
Should it be said that there is a natural body
and a spiritual body in existence at the same
time, we answer that according to Paul, that is
not so. He says, verse 46: “Howbeit that was
not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural;
and <em>afterward</em> that which is spiritual.” In
verse 49, he says we have borne the image of the
earthly, and we shall bear, future, the image of
the heavenly; and this will be when this mortal
and corruptible, which is this mortal body, puts
on incorruption, verses 52, 53, or is clothed upon
with the house from Heaven. 2 Cor. 5.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the Philippians, Paul testifies again on this
point: “For our conversation is in Heaven, from
whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord
Jesus Christ, who shall <em>change our vile body</em>, that
it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.”
This language is explicit. A change is to be
wrought in the vile, mortal or corruptible body
of this present state, not a spiritual body released
from it, which never sees death and needs
no change; and the change that is promised is,
that this body taken as it now is, is to be fashioned,
changed over, into the likeness of Christ’s
glorious, immortal body.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having thus shown that a future resurrection
is an event of the most absolute necessity, inasmuch
as without it there is no future existence
for the human race (a fact which entirely destroys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>at one blow the doctrine of the immortality of
the soul), we now propose to notice the prominence
given to this event in the sacred writings,
and some of the plain declarations that it will
surely take place.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. The resurrection is the great event to which
the sacred writers looked forward as the object of
their hope. In the far distant ages a day rose to
their view in which the dead came forth from
their graves, and stood before God; and before
the coming of that day, they did not expect eternal
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Job testifies: “I know that my Redeemer
liveth, and that he will stand at the latter day
upon the earth. And though after my skin
worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I
see God.” Job 19:25, 26.</p>

<p class='c011'>David entertained the same satisfactory hope.
“As for me,” he says, “I shall be satisfied when
I awake with Thy likeness.” Ps. 17:15.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isaiah struck some thrilling notes on the same
theme: “Thy dead men shall live, together with
my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing,
ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is as the dew
of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.”
Isa. 26:19.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the hope of Paul, that eminent apostle,
through all his sufferings and toils. For this he
could sacrifice any temporal good, and take up
any cross. He assures us that he considered his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>afflictions, his troubles on every side, his perplexities,
persecutions, stripes, imprisonments, and
perils, but light afflictions; yea, he could utterly
lose sight of them; and then he tells us why he
could do it: it was in view of “the glory which
shall be revealed in us,” “knowing,” says he,
“that He which raised up the Lord Jesus, <em>shall
raise us up also by Jesus</em>, and shall present us
with you.” 2 Cor. 4:14. The assurance that he
should be raised up at the last day, and be presented
with the rest of the saints, when the Lord
shall present to his Father a church without spot
or wrinkle or any such thing, Eph. 5:27, sustained
him under all his burdens. The resurrection
was the staff of his hope. Again he says
that he could count all things loss, if by any
means he might attain to a resurrection (<em>exanastasis</em>)
out from among the dead. Phil. 3:8-11.</p>

<p class='c011'>We refer to one more passage which expresses
as clearly as language can do it, the apostle’s
hope. 2 Cor. 1:8, 9: “For we would not, brethren,
have you ignorant of our trouble which
came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of
measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired
even of life. But we had the sentence of
death in ourselves, that we should not trust in
ourselves, but in God <em>which raiseth the dead</em>.”
Paul here gives us to understand that he could
not trust in himself because he was mortal. He
must therefore put his trust in God; and he tells
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>us why he does this: not because God had
promised him any happiness as a disembodied
soul; but because he was able and willing <em>to raise
him from the dead</em>. Paul “kept back nothing
that was profitable,” and did not shun “to declare
all the counsel of God,” yet he never once
endeavored to console himself or his brethren by
any allusion to a disembodied state of existence,
but passed over this as if it were not at all to be
taken into the account, and fixed all his hope on
the resurrection. Why this, if going to Heaven
or hell at death, be a gospel doctrine?</p>

<p class='c011'>2. The resurrection is the time to which prophets
and apostles looked forward as the day of
their reward. Should any one carefully search
the Bible to ascertain the time which it designates
as the time of reward to the righteous, and
punishment to the wicked, he would find it to
be not at death, but at the resurrection. Our
Saviour clearly sets forth this fact in Luke 14:13,
14: “But when thou makest a feast, call the
poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind; and thou
shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense
thee; for thou shalt be recompensed,” not at
death, but, “<em>at the resurrection of the just</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mark also the language by which the Lord
would restrain that voice of weeping which was
heard in Ramah. When Herod sent forth and
slew all the children in Bethlehem from two
years old and under, in hopes thereby to put to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>death the infant Saviour, then was fulfilled, says
Matthew, what was spoken by the prophet, “In
Ramah was there a voice heard, lamentation, and
weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for
her children, and would not be comforted, because
they were not.” But what said the Lord
to Rachel? See the original prophecy, Jer. 31:15-17:
“Thus saith the Lord, Refrain thy voice
from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for thy
work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they
shall come again from the land of the enemy.
And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord,
that thy children shall come again to their own
border.” Not thus would the mourning Rachels
of the 19th century be comforted by the professed
shepherds of the flock of Christ. They
would tell them, Refrain thy voice from weeping;
for thy sons are now angel cherubs chanting their
joyful anthems in their Heavenly Father’s home.
But the Lord points the mourners in Ramah
forward to the resurrection for their hope; and
though till that time their children “were not,”
or were out of existence, in the land of death, the
great enemy of our race, yet, says the Lord, they
shall come again from the land of the enemy,
they shall return again to their own border, and
thy work shall be rewarded; and he bids them
refrain their voices from weeping, their eyes from
tears, and their hearts from sorrow, in view of
that glorious event.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>The apostles represent the day of Christ’s coming
and the resurrection as the time when the
saints will receive their crowns of glory. Says
Peter, “And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear,
ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth
not away.” 1 Pet. 5:4. And Paul says that
there is laid up for him a crown of righteousness,
and not for him only, but for all those also that
love his appearing, and which shall be given him
in that day (the day of Christ’s appearing).
These holy apostles were not expecting their
crowns of reward sooner than this.</p>

<p class='c011'>All this is utterly inconsistent with the idea
of a conscious intermediate state, and rewards or
punishments at death. But the word of God
must stand, and the theories of men must bow to
its authority.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1 Cor. 15:32, Paul further tells us when he
expected to reap advantage or reward for all the
dangers he incurred here in behalf of the truth:
“If after the manner of men I have fought with
beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the
dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to-morrow
we die.” If without a resurrection he would
receive no reward, it is evident that he expected
his reward at that time, but not before. His
language here is moreover a re-iteration of verse
18, that if there is no resurrection, they which
are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our Lord testified that of all which the Father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>had given him he should lose nothing, but would
raise it up at the last day. This language is also
at once a positive declaration that the resurrection
shall take place, and that without this event,
all is lost. To the same effect is 1 Cor. 15:52,
53, “The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
For this corruptible <em>must</em> put on incorruption,
and this mortal <em>must</em> put on immortality.” Here
is a plain announcement that the resurrection
will take place; that the change mentioned will
be wrought at that time; and that this change
must take place or we cannot inherit the kingdom
of God. Verse 50. Therefore, without a
resurrection, none who have fallen in death will
ever behold the kingdom of God.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. The resurrection is made the basis of many
of the comforting promises of Scripture. 1 Thess.
4:16, 17: “For the Lord himself shall descend
from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel, and with the trump of God; and the
dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which
are alive and remain shall be caught up together
with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”
We have already referred to this passage in this
chapter on the Resurrection. We quote it again
to show that God designed that from these promises
we should comfort ourselves and one another
in that keenest of all our afflictions, and the darkest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>of all our hours, the hour of bereavement.
For the apostle immediately adds, “Wherefore
comfort one another with these words.” Is it to
such facts as these, the second coming of Christ,
and the resurrection of the dead, that the theology
of our day appeals to alleviate the sorrow
which the human heart will feel for the loss of
departed loved ones? Here, if anywhere, and
on this subject, if on any that the apostle has
anywhere taken up, should come in the modern
doctrine of uninterrupted consciousness in the
intermediate state. But Paul was evidently
against any such doctrine, and so denies it a
place on the page of truth, but passes right over
to the resurrection as the place where comfort is
to be found for the mourners.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the resurrection is inseparably connected
with the second coming of Christ, the words of
Christ in John 14:1-3, are equally in point on
this question. When he was about to leave his
sorrowing disciples, he told them that he was
going to prepare a place for them; he informed
them moreover of his design that they should
ultimately be with himself. But how was this
to be accomplished? Was it through death, by
which a deathless spirit would be released to
soar away to meet its Saviour? No; but, says
he, I will <em>come again</em> and receive you to myself,
that where I am, there ye may be also. Should
any say that this coming of the Saviour is at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>death, we reply that the disciples of our Lord
did not so understand it. See John 21:22, 23.
Jesus incidentally remarked concerning one of
his followers, “If I will that he tarry <em>till I come</em>,
what is that to thee? follow thou me;” and the
saying went immediately abroad among the disciples,
on the strength of these words, that that
disciple should <em>not die</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The eminent and pious Joseph Alleine also
testifies:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“But we shall lift up our heads because the day of our
redemption draweth nigh. This is the day I look for,
and wait for, and have laid up all my hopes in. If the
Lord return not, I profess myself undone; my preaching
is vain, and my suffering is vain. The thing, you see, is
established, and every circumstance is determined. How
sweet are the words that dropped from the precious lips
of our departing Lord! What generous cordials hath he
left us in his parting sermon and his last prayer! And
yet of all the rest these are the sweetest: ‘I will come
again and receive you unto myself, that where I am
there ye may be also.’ What need you any further witness?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Clarke, in his general remarks on 1 Cor.
15, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The doctrine of the resurrection appears to have
been thought of much more consequence among the
primitive Christians than it is <em>now</em>. How is this? The
apostles were continually insisting on it, and exciting the
followers of God to diligence, obedience, and cheerfulness
through it. And their successors in the present day seldom
mention it.... There is not a doctrine in the
gospel on which more stress is laid; and there is not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>doctrine in the present system of preaching, which is
treated with more neglect.”</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVII. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE JUDGMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We have seen how the grand doctrine of the
future resurrection of the dead, demolishes with
its ponderous weight the gossamer fabric of the
immortality of the soul. There is another doctrine
as scriptural and as prominent as the resurrection
which opposes its impregnable battlements
to the same anti-scriptural fable--a fable, weak,
though encased in the coat of mail with which
heathendom furnishes it, and not very imposing
in appearance, though adorned with the gorgeous
trappings of the mother of harlots. We refer to
the doctrine of the future general Judgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>This doctrine, and the theory of the conscious
state of the dead, cannot exist together. There
is an antagonism between them, irreconcilable,
and irrepressible. If every man is judged at
death, as he indeed must be, if an immortal soul
survives the dissolution of the body, and enters
at once into the happiness or misery of the eternal
state, accordingly as its character has been
good or bad, there is no occasion and no room for
a general Judgment in the future; and if, on the
other hand, there is to be such a future Judgment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>it is proof positive that the other doctrine is not
true.</p>

<p class='c011'>We affirm, then, that the Scriptures clearly
teach that there is to be a general Judgment in
the future, at which time such awards shall be
rendered to every one as shall accord with the
record of his deeds. A passage in Hebrews may
seem to some minds to afford proof that the
Judgment follows immediately after death, and
which may, consequently, demand a brief notice
at this point. Heb. 9:27: “And as it is appointed
unto men once to die, but after this the
Judgment.” The sentence does not end here,
but is continued into the next verse: “<em>So</em> Christ
was once offered to bear the sins of many.”
From this it is evident that the death to which
Paul refers is some death which illustrates the
death of Christ as an offering for sin: As men
die, and after this the Judgment, <em>so</em> (in like manner)
Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
many. It is not then the common death of human
beings to which the apostle refers; for there
is nothing in this death to show how Christ died
as an offering for sin.</p>

<p class='c011'>This language occurs at the conclusion of an
argument on the priesthood of Christ, as illustrated
by the priesthood connected with the
Jewish service. Under that dispensation there
was a yearly round of service connected with the
worldly sanctuary. On the day of atonement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>when the sanctuary was to be cleansed, a goat
was slain for all the people. Their life was imputed
to it, and in it they in figure died. The
blood of this goat, representing the forfeited lives
of the people, was then ministered in the most
holy place, which was a work of determination
and decision in their cases, which the word here
rendered judgment signifies. So Christ, the antitype,
was once offered, and, if we avail ourselves
of his intercession, his blood is accepted instead
of our forfeited lives, and we shall stand acquitted
in the real Judgment work in the sanctuary
above, as Israel were acquitted when the same
work was performed in figure in the worldly
sanctuary of the former dispensation. This text,
therefore, not referring to the end of individual
mortal life, and its relation to future retribution,
has no relevancy to the question under discussion.</p>

<p class='c011'>We return to the proposition that a future
general Judgment is appointed. Paul reasoned
before Felix of a Judgment to come. Acts 24:25.
But as it may be said that this was to be
experienced when Felix died, we will introduce
another text which not only speaks of this Judgment
as future, but shows that it will pass simultaneously
on the human race: Acts 17:31:
“Because he hath appointed a day in the which
he will judge the world in righteousness by that
man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>given assurance unto all men in that he hath
raised him from the dead.” Here it is announced
in plain terms that the Judgment of this world
is future, that it is to take place at the time appointed,
and that a day, or period, is set apart for
this purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peter refers to the same day and says that the
angels that sinned, and the unjust of our own
race, are reserved unto it. 2 Pet. 2:4, 9. Again
he says that this present earth is reserved unto
fire, with which it shall be destroyed in that day.
2 Pet. 3:7-12. Jude says that the angels that
kept not their first estate are reserved in everlasting
chains under darkness unto the Judgment
of the great day. Jude 6. This is the day when
Christ is represented as separating the good from
the bad, as a shepherd divideth the sheep from
the goats, Matt. 25:31-34, and the time to which
John looked forward when he said that he saw
the dead, small and great, stand before God, and
the books were opened, and they were judged
out of those things written in the books.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Judgment also stands in many lines of
prophecy, not as something which has been going
forward from the beginning, not as taking place
as each member of the human family passes from
the stage of mortal existence, but as the great
event with which the probation of the human
race is to end. Testimony on this point need not
be multiplied. It cannot be denied that a day is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>coming in which sentence will be rendered at
once upon all who have lived a life of probation
in this world, a sentence which shall decide their
condition for the eternity that lies beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>This fact being established, its bearing upon
the question of consciousness in death, cannot be
overlooked. For, if every human being at death
passes at once into a state of reward or punishment,
what occasion is there for a future general
Judgment that a second decision may be rendered
in their cases? Is it possible that a mistake
was made in the former decision? possible that
some are now writhing in the flames of hell, who
should be basking in the bliss of Heaven? possible
that some are taking their fill of happiness
in the bowers of paradise, whose corrupt hearts
and criminal life demand that they should have
their place with fiends in the lowest hell? And
if mistakes have once been made in the sentence
rendered, may they not be made again? What
assurance can we have that, though we may be
entitled by thorough repentance to the happiness
of Heaven, we may not be sentenced for all eternity
to the damnation of hell? Is it possible
that such foul blots of injustice stand upon the
record of the government of Heaven? Yes, if
the conscious-state theory be true! We arraign
that theory face to face with this stupendous
fact, and bid it behold its work. It destroys
God’s omniscience! It charges him with imperfection!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>It accuses his government of mistakes
which are worse than crimes! Is any theory,
which is subject to such overwhelming imputations,
worthy of a moment’s credence?</p>

<p class='c011'>To avoid the foregoing fatal conclusions, is it
said that sentence is not passed at death, but
that the dead are held somewhere in a state of
suspense, without being either rewarded or punished
till the Judgment? Then we inquire how
this can be harmonized with the invariable arguments
which immaterialists use on this question?
For is it not claimed that the spirit goes immediately
to God to receive sentence from the hand
of its Creator? Is it not claimed that the rich
man was immediately after death in hell, in
torment? Is it not claimed that the repentant
thief was that very day with Christ in the joys
of paradise? If these instances and arguments
are abandoned, let it be so understood. If not,
then no such after thought can be resorted to, to
shield the conscious-state dogma from the charges
above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>We close this argument with a paragraph from
the candid pen of H. H. Dobney, Baptist minister
of England. In Future Punishment, pp. 139,
140, he says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“There is something of awkwardness, which the
Scriptures seem to avoid, in making beings who have
already entered, and many ages since, on a state of happiness
or misery, come from those abodes to be judged,
and to receive a formal award to the very condition which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>has long been familiar to them. To have been in Heaven
with Christ for glorious ages, and then to stand at his bar
for Judgment, and be invited to enter Heaven as their
eternal home, as though they had not been there already,
scarcely seems to look exactly like the Scripture account,
while it would almost appear to be wanting in congruity.
Nor is this all. There is another difficulty, namely:
That the idea of a saint already ‘with Christ,’ ‘present
with the Lord’ (who is in Heaven, be it remembered, in
his resurrection and glorified body, wherewith he ascended
from the brow of Olivet), coming from Heaven to
earth to glide into a body raised simultaneously from the
ground, he being in reality already possessed of a spiritual
body, would seem <em>an invention which has not one syllable
in Scripture to give it countenance</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We have now examined the teaching of the
Bible relative to man, in his creation, in his life,
in his death, and in the intermediate state to his
resurrection; and we have found its uniform and
explicit testimony to be that he has no inherent,
inalienable principle in his nature which is exempt
from death; but that the only avenue to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>life beyond the grave is through the resurrection.
We have found also that such a resurrection to a
second life is decreed for all the race; and now
the more momentous question, what the issue of
that existence is to be, presents itself for solution.</p>

<p class='c011'>Natural, or temporal, death, we die in Adam.
This death visits all alike irrespective of character.
The sincerest saint falls under its power, as
inevitably as the most reckless sinner. This cannot
be our final end; for it would not be in accordance
with justice that our ultimate fate should
hinge on a transaction, like the sin of Adam, for
which we are not responsible. Every person
must be the arbiter of his own destiny. To secure
this, the redemption which intervenes
through Christ, provides for all a release from
the death entailed upon us by the Adamic transgression,
in order that every person’s individual
acts may constitute the record which shall determine
his destiny beyond the grave. What is
that destiny to be?</p>

<p class='c011'>Our inquiry respects, not the future of the
righteous, concerning which there is no material
controversy, but that of the sinner. Is his fate
an eternity of life in a devouring fire which is
forever unable to devour him? an eternal approach
of death which never really arrives?</p>

<p class='c011'>Blinded by the doctrine of the immortality of
the soul, two opposite conclusions are reached by
those who connect this doctrine with two different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>classes of Scripture declarations. For one
class, reading that the punishment of the sinner
is to be eternal, and holding that man has an inherent
immortality which can never be alienated,
at once come to the terrible conclusion of an eternity
of conscious suffering, an eternal hell as
taught by Augustine. Another, connecting it
with the declarations that God’s anger shall not
always burn against the wicked, but that a time
comes when every intelligence in the universe,
in the plenitude of joy, is heard ascribing honor,
and blessing, and praise to God, speedily reaches
the conclusion of universal restoration as taught
by Origen. And if the doctrine of the immortality
of the soul be a scriptural doctrine, then the
Scriptures are found supporting these two diametrically
opposite conclusions.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have seen that the Scriptures do not teach
any such inherent immortality as is claimed for
man; this, therefore, cannot fetter us in our investigation
of this question. God can continue
the existence of the wicked to all eternity after
the resurrection, if he so chooses; but if so, the
doctrine must rest on explicit statements of the
Scriptures to that effect. Paul says plainly that
the wages of sin is death; Rom. 6:23; and as
we do not receive wages for the work of another,
this must be a declaration of what will result to
every individual for a course of sin; and before
this can be made to mean eternal life in misery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>the present constitution of language must be destroyed,
and new definitions be given to established
terms. We hold this declaration of Paul’s,
on which we take our stand, to be the true
ground between the errors above mentioned, and
one which not only harmonizes all the Bible on
this question, but which has abundance of positive
testimony in its favor.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. The future punishment, threatened to the
wicked, is to be eternal in its duration. The establishment
of this proposition, of course overthrows
the universal restoration of Origen; and
the nature of this punishment, involving a state
of death, overthrows alike the restoration view
of Origen, and the eternal hell of Augustine.</p>

<p class='c011'>One “Thus saith the Lord,” is sufficient for
the establishment of any doctrine. One such we
offer in support of the proposition now before us.
Speaking of the reprobate, Christ says, “And
these shall go away into everlasting punishment,”
and immediately adds concerning the righteous,
“but the righteous, into life eternal.” Here the
same Greek word, <em>aionios</em>, is used to express the
duration of these opposite states. If, as must be
admitted, the word expresses unending duration
in the case of the righteous, it must mean the
same in that of the wicked.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the same end we might refer to the words
of Christ on two other occasions: John 3:36;
Matt. 26:24. In the first of these passages he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>says: “He that believeth not the Son shall not
see life;” that is, eternal life. But if, after a certain
period of suffering, such persons are released
from that state by a restoration to God’s favor,
this declaration could not be true. In the second,
he speaks of some of whom he says that it
would be good for them if they had not been
born. And this utterly precludes the idea that
they should ever be released to enter the bliss of
Heaven; for the first moment of such release
would make amends for all past suffering; and
throughout eternity they would praise God that
they had been born.</p>

<p class='c011'>The punishment of the wicked, alike with the
reward of the righteous, is therefore to be eternal.
Two unending conditions are held out to
men, and between the two, they have the privilege
in this life of choosing.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. In what will the eternal state of the wicked
consist? Before presenting an argument to show
that it is death in the literal sense, it may be
necessary to notice the few passages of Scripture
which are put forth as evidence that it is eternal
misery.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. Daniel 12:2: “And many of them that
sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some
to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting
contempt.” The shame spoken of in this
text is coupled by the objector with the contempt,
and claimed to be like that, everlasting;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>and if the shame, which is an emotion to be exercised
by the individuals themselves, is to be
eternal, they must be awakened to everlasting
life and consciousness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fact that they are raised to shame proves
indeed that they have a veritable resurrection to
life and consciousness, and that this is no figure
of speech which is applied to them. But the
reader will notice that the shame is not said, like
the contempt, to be everlasting. Contempt is
not an emotion which they feel; they are not
raised to the contempt of themselves; but it is
an emotion felt by others toward them; and this
does not imply the consciousness of those against
whom it is directed; inasmuch as contempt may
be felt for them as well after they have passed
from the stage of consciousness as before. The
Syriac sustains this idea. It reads, “Some to
shame and the eternal contempt of their companions.”
And thus it will be. Shame for their
wickedness and corruption will burn into their
very souls, so long as they have conscious being.
And when they pass away, consumed for their
iniquities, their loathsome characters and their
guilty deeds, excite only contempt on the part of
the righteous, unmodified and unabated, so long
as they hold them in remembrance at all. The
text, therefore, furnishes no proof of the eternal
suffering of the wicked.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Matt. 25:41: “Depart from me, ye cursed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and
his angels.” What is here said to be everlasting?
Wicked men? No. The devil? No. His angels?
No. But only the fire. And how can
the application of this term to the fire prove the
indestructibility and eternal life of those who are
cast therein? It may be answered, What propriety
could there be in keeping up the fire everlastingly,
if its victims were not to be eternally
the objects of its power? And we reply, This
word is sometimes used to denote the results and
not the continuance of the process. Everlasting
fire may not be fire which is everlastingly burning,
but fire which produces results which are everlasting
in their nature. The victims cast therein
will be consumed, and if from that destruction
they are never to be released, if that fiery work
is never to be undone, it is to them an everlasting
fire. This will appear more fully when we
come to speak of the “eternal fire” through
which God’s vengeance was visited on the wicked
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are several passages of scripture in which
the same word, <em>aionios</em>, is unquestionably used
in this sense. In Heb. 5:9, we read of “eternal
salvation;” that is, a salvation which is eternal
or everlasting in its results, not one which is forever
going on, but never accomplished. In Heb.
6:2, Paul speaks of “eternal judgment;” not
judgment which is eternally going forward, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>one which, having once passed upon all men,
Acts 17:31, is irreversible in its decisions, and
eternal in its effects. In Heb. 9:12, he speaks
in the same way of “eternal redemption,” not a
redemption through which we are eternally approaching
a redeemed state which we never
reach, but a redemption which releases us for all
eternity from the power of sin and death. It
would be just as proper to speak of the saints as
always redeeming, but never redeemed, as to
to speak of the sinner as always consuming but
never consumed, or always dying but never dead.
This fire is prepared for the devil and his angels,
and will be shared by all of the human race who
choose to follow the devil in his accursed rebellion
against the government of Heaven. It will
be to them an everlasting fire; for once having
plunged into its fiery vortex, there is no life, beyond.

</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>Matt. 25:46: “And these shall go away into everlasting
punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>This text is very commonly urged as an objection
against the view that the destiny of the
reprobate is an utter and eternal extinction of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>being; and it is one which has great apparent
force. But the secret of this apparent strength
lies in the fact that the term punishment is almost
invariably supposed to be confined to conscious
suffering, and that when any affliction is
no longer taken cognizance of by the senses, it
ceases to be a punishment at all. But if it can
be shown from sound reason, and from the analogy
of human penalties, that punishment is estimated
by the loss involved, and not merely by
the amount of pain inflicted, the objection vanishes
at once, and will cease to hold back many
devout and holy minds from adopting the view
we here advocate.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the duration of the punishment brought to
view in the text, we take no issue. It is to be
eternal; but what is to be its nature? The text
says, Everlasting punishment; popular orthodoxy
says, Unending misery; the Bible, we
believe, says, Eternal death.</p>

<p class='c011'>Is death punishment? If so, when a death is
inflicted from which there is to be no release, that
punishment is eternal or everlasting. Then the
application of this scripture to the view we hold
is very apparent. The heathen, to reconcile
themselves to what they supposed to be their
inevitable fate, used to argue that death was no
evil. But when they looked forward into the
endless future of which that death deprived them,
they were obliged to reverse their former decision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>and acknowledge that death was an <em>endless injury</em>.--<cite>Cicero,
Tusc. Disp.</cite> i., 47.</p>

<p class='c011'>Why is the sentence of death in our courts of
justice reckoned as the most severe and greatest
punishment? It is not because the pain involved
is greater; for the scourge, the rack, the pillory,
and many kinds of minor punishment, inflict
more pain upon the petty offender than decapitation
or hanging inflicts upon the murderer.
But it is reckoned the greatest because it is the
most lasting; and its length is estimated by the
life the person would have enjoyed, if it had not
been inflicted. It has deprived him of every
hour of that life he would have had but for this
punishment; and hence the punishment is considered
as co-existent with the period of his natural
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Augustine says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The laws do not estimate the punishment of a criminal
by the brief period during which he is being put to
death, but by their removing him forever from the company
of living men.”--<cite>De. civ. Dei, xxi.</cite>, 11.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The same reasoning applies to the future life
as readily as to the present. By the terrible
infliction of the second death, the sinner is deprived
of all the bright and ceaseless years of
everlasting life. The loss of every moment, hour,
and year, of this life, is a punishment; and, as
the life is eternal, the loss, or the punishment, is
eternal also. “There is here no straining of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>argument to make out a case. The argument is
one which man’s judgment has in every age approved
as just.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The original sustains the same idea. The
word for punishment is <em>kolasis</em>; and this is defined,
“a curtailing, a pruning.” The idea of
cutting off is here prominent. The righteous go
into everlasting life, but the wicked, into an everlasting
state in which they are curtailed or cut
off. Cut off from what? Not from happiness;
for that is not the subject of discourse; but from
life, as expressly stated in reference to the righteous.
“The wages of sin is death; but the gift
of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
Lord.” And since the life given to man through
Christ, is eternal life, it follows that the loss of it
inflicted as a punishment, is eternal punishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same objection is again stated in a little
different form. As in the ages before our existence
we suffered no punishment, so, it is claimed
it will be no punishment to be reduced to that
state again. To this, we reply, that those who
never had an existence cannot, of course, be conceived
of in relation to rewards and punishments
at all. But when a person has once seen the
light of life, when he has lived long enough to
taste its sweets and appreciate its blessings, is it
then no punishment to be deprived of it? Says
Luther Lee (Immortality of the Soul, p. 128),
“We maintain that the simple loss of existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>cannot be a penalty or punishment in the circumstances
of the sinner after the general resurrection.”
And what are these circumstances?
He comes up to the beloved city, and sees the
people of God in the everlasting kingdom. He
sees before them an eternity, not of life only, but
of bliss and glory indescribable, while before
himself is only the blackness of darkness forever.
Then, says the Saviour, addressing a class of
sinners, there shall be wailing and gnashing of
teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, in the kingdom of God. What is the
cause of this wailing? It is not that they have
to choose between annihilation or eternal torture.
Had they this privilege, some might perhaps
choose the former; others would not. But the
cause of their woe is not that they are to receive
a certain kind of punishment when they would
prefer another, but because they have lost the life
and blessedness which they now behold in possession
of the righteous. The only conditions
between which they can draw their cheerless
comparisons are, the blessed and happy state of
the righteous within the city of God, and their
own hapless lot outside of its walls. And we
may well infer from the nature of the case, as
well as the Saviour’s language, that it is <em>because</em>
they find themselves thus thrust out, that they
lift up their voices in lamentation and woe.
“There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>when ye shall see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
in the kingdom of God, <em>and ye yourselves thrust
out</em>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sinner then begins to see what he has lost;
the sense of it, like a barbed arrow, pierces his
soul; and the thought that the glorious inheritance
before him might have been his but for his
own self-willed and perverse career, sets the
keenest edge upon every pang of remorse. And
as he looks far away into eternity, to the utmost
limit which the mind’s eye can reach, and gets a
glimpse of the inconceivable blessedness and
glory which he might have enjoyed but for his
idol sin, the hopeless thought that all is lost will
be sufficient to rend the hardest and most obdurate
heart with unutterable agony. Say not then
that loss of existence under such circumstances is
no penalty or punishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>But again: The Bible plainly teaches degrees
of punishment; and how is this compatible, it is
asked, with the idea of a mere state of death to
which all alike will be reduced? Let us ask
believers in eternal misery how they will maintain
degrees in <em>their</em> system? They tell us the
intensity of the pain endured will be in each
case proportioned to the guilt of the sufferer.
But how can this be? Are not the flames of hell
equally severe in all parts? and will they not
equally affect <em>all</em> the immaterial souls cast therein?
But God can interpose, it is answered, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>produce the effect desired. Very well, then, we
reply, cannot he also interpose, if necessary,
according to our view, and graduate the pain
attendant upon the sinner’s being reduced to a
state of death as the climax of his penalty? So,
then, our view is equal with the common one in
this respect, while it possesses a great advantage
over it in another; for, while that has to find its
degrees of punishment in intensity of pain alone,
the duration in all cases being equal, ours may
have not only degrees in pain, but in duration
also; for, while some may perish in a short space
of time, the weary sufferings of others may be
long drawn out. But yet we apprehend that the
bodily suffering will be but an unnoticed trifle
compared with the mental agony, that keen
anguish which will rack their souls as they get
a view of their incomparable loss, each according
to his capacity of appreciation. The youth who
had but little more than reached the years of accountability
and died, perhaps with just enough
guilt upon him to debar him from Heaven, being
less able to comprehend his situation and his loss,
will of course feel it less. To him of older years,
more capacity, and consequently a deeper experience
in sin, the burden of his fate will be proportionately
greater. While the man of giant
intellect, and almost boundless comprehension,
who thereby possessed greater influence for evil,
and hence was the more guilty for devoting those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>powers to that evil, being able to understand his
situation fully, comprehend his fate and realize
his loss, will feel it most keenly of all. Into <em>his</em>
soul indeed the iron will enter most intolerably
deep. And thus, by an established law of mind,
the sufferings of each may be most accurately
adjusted to the magnitude of his guilt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, says one, the sinner will long for death
as a release from his evils, and experience a sense
of relief when all is over. No, friend, not even
this pitiful semblance of consolation is granted;
for no such sense of relief will ever come. The
words of another will best illustrate this point:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“‘But the sense of relief when death comes at last.’
We hardly need to reply: There can be no sense of relief.
The light of life gone out, the expired soul can never
know that it has escaped from pain. The bold transgressor
may fix his thoughts upon it now, heedless of all
that intervenes; but he will forget to think of it then.
To waken from a troubled dream, and to know that it was
only a dream, is an exceeding joy; and with transport do
the friends of one dying in delirium, note a gleam of returning
reason, ere he breathes his last. But the soul’s
death knows no waking; its maddening fever ends in no
sweet moment of rest. It can never feel that its woe is
ended. The agony ends, not in a happy consciousness
that all is past, but in eternal night--in the blackness of
darkness forever!”--<cite>Debt and Grace</cite>, p. 424.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXX. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE UNDYING WORM AND QUENCHLESS FIRE.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>Mark 9:43, 44: “And if thy hand offend thee, cut it
off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than
having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never
shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the
fire is not quenched.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Twice our Lord repeats this solemn sentence
against the wicked, “Where their worm dieth
not, and the fire is not quenched.” Verses 46, 48.
These passages are relied on with as much assurance,
perhaps, as any, to prove the eternal misery
of the reprobate. If this language had
never been used by any of the inspired writers
of the Scriptures, till it was thus used in the
New Testament, it might be urged with some degree
of plausibility, as an expressive imagery of
eternal torment. But, even in this case, it might
be replied that fire, so far as we have any experience
with it, or knowledge of its nature, invariably
consumes that upon which it preys, and
hence must be a symbol of complete destruction;
and that the expression, as it occurs in Mark 9:44,
can denote nothing less than the utter consumption
of those who are cast into that fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this expression was one which was well
known and understood by those whom Christ
was addressing. Isaiah and Jeremiah frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>use the figure of the undying worm and quenchless
fire. In their familiar scriptures the people
daily read these expressions. Let us see what
idea they would derive from them. We turn to
Jeremiah 17:27, and read:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the
Sabbath day, and not bear a burden, even entering in at
the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then will I
kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the
palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>From this text we certainly can learn the
meaning that was attached to the expression,
“unquenchable fire,” by the Hebrew people.
This fire was not to be quenched, therefore it
was unquenchable. But it was to be kindled in
the gates of Jerusalem, and devour the palaces
thereof. It was therefore literal, natural, fire.
But how could a fire of this kind, thus kindled,
be supposed to be a fire that would burn eternally?
They certainly would not so understand it. No
more should we. Moreover, this threatening of
the Lord by Jeremiah was fulfilled. 2 Chron.
36:19: “And they burnt the house of God, and
brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all
the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all
the goodly vessels thereof.” Verse 21. “To fulfill
the word of the Lord by Jeremiah.” Thus
Jerusalem was burned according to Jeremiah’s
prediction that it should be consumed in unquenchable
fire. But how long did that fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>burn? Only till it had reduced to ashes the
gates and palaces on which it preyed. Unquenchable
fire is therefore simply a fire that is
not quenched, or does not cease, till it has entirely
consumed that which causes or supports it. Then
it dies out of itself, because there is nothing more
to burn. The expression does not mean a fire
that must absolutely eternally burn, and that
consequently all that is cast therein to feed the
flame must forever be preserved by having the
portion consumed immediately renewed.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the wicked the threatened fire is unquenchable
because it will not be quenched, or caused to
cease, till it has entirely devoured them.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>Ps. 37: 20: “But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies
of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs; they
shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.”
Mal. 4: 3: “And ye shall tread down the wicked; for
they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day
that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Ezekiel speaks of unquenchable fire in a similar
manner.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>Eze. 20: 47, 48: “Thus saith the Lord God: Behold
I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green
tree in thee, and every dry tree; the flaming flame shall
not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north
shall be burned therein. And all flesh shall see that I the
Lord have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Though this is doubtless figurative language,
denoting sore calamities upon a certain land
called the forest of the south field, it nevertheless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>furnishes an instance of how the expression,
unquenchable fire, was then used and understood;
for that generation many ages ago perished, and
those judgments long since ceased to exist.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isaiah not only speaks of the unquenchable
fire, but he couples with it the undying worm,
the same as the language in Mark:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>Isa. 66: 24: “And they shall go forth and look upon
the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against
me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire
be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring unto all
flesh.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>This is undoubtedly the language from which
the expression in Mark is borrowed; but a moment’s
examination of it will show that the worm
is not the remorse of a guilty conscience, but
that, like the fire, it is something external to, and
distinct from, the objects upon which it preys;
and moreover that those upon whom it feeds are
not the living, but the dead: it is the “carcasses”
of the men that have transgressed against the
Lord. In Isa. 14: 11, and 51: 8, the prophet
again speaks of the worm as an agent of destruction,
but it is always in connection with death.
It is thus evident that the terms employed by
our Lord in describing the doom of the wicked
would convey to the minds of his hearers the
very opposite of the idea of eternal life in misery.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is other evidence, though no other is
necessary, to show that the idea which would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>conveyed, and which the language was designed
to convey, to their minds, was that of complete
extinction of being, an utter consumption by external
elements of destruction. The word translated
hell in the passage under consideration is
<em>ge-enna</em>. It is better to enter into life maimed,
than to go in full possession of all our members
and faculties into <em>ge-enna</em>. Did those to whom
Christ spoke know anything about this place,
and what kind of a fate awaited those who were
cast therein? A vivid picture of the place of
torment to which our Lord refers was in constant
operation before their eyes, near by Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c011'>Greenfield defines the word thus:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Gehenna, the valley of Hinnom, south of Jerusalem,
once celebrated for the horrid worship of Moloch and
afterward polluted with every species of filth, as well as
the carcasses of animals and dead bodies of malefactors;
to <em>consume which</em>, in order to avert the pestilence which
such a mass of corruption would occasion, constant fires
were kept burning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Such was the fire of Gehenna; not a fire into
which people were cast to be kept alive and
tortured, but one into which they were cast to be
consumed; not one which was designed to prey
upon living beings, but upon the carcasses of
animals and the dead bodies of malefactors.
Hence we can see the consistency of associating
the fire and the worm together. Whatever portion
of the dead body the fire failed to consume,
the worm would soon seize upon and devour. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>a person had been condemned to be cast alive
into this place, as the wicked will be cast into
their Gehenna, what would have been his hope
of escape? If the fire could have been speedily
quenched before it had taken his life, and the
worms which consumed what the fire left, could
have been destroyed, he might have had some
hope of coming out alive; but if this could not
be done, he would know of a surety that his life
would soon become extinct, and then even his
lifeless remains would be utterly consumed by
these agents of destruction.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the scene to which Christ pointed his
hearers to represent the doom that awaits the
wicked; that, as they gazed upon the work of
complete destruction going on in the valley of
Hinnom, the worms devouring what the flames
spared, they might learn that in the future Gehenna
which awaited them, no part of their being
would be exempt from utter and complete destruction,
one agent of death completing what
another failed to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the definition of the word <em>ge-enna</em> throws
great light on the meaning of this text, so
the definition of another term used is equally to
the point. The words for unquenchable fire are
<em>pur</em> (long u) <em>asbeston</em>, and this word <em>asbeston</em>,
primarily means simply unquenched, that is, not
caused to cease by any external means: the idea
of eternal is a theological definition which has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>been attached to it. Ancient writers used it in
this sense. Homer, in the <a id='corr285.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic: Iliad'>Illiad</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_285.2'><ins class='correction' title='sic: Iliad'>Illiad</ins></a></span>, xvi., 123, 294,
speaks of the Trojans’ hurling “unquenchable
fire” upon the Grecian ships, though but one of
them was burnt by it. And Eusebius, who was
a learned Greek, employs the same expression in
two instances in recounting the martyrdom of
Christians. Cronion and Julian, after being tortured
in various ways, were consumed in an
“unquenchable fire,” <em>puri asbesto</em>. The same is
also said of Epimachus and Alexander. “The
<em>pur asbeston</em>,” says Wetstein, “denotes such a
fire as cannot be <a id='corr285.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='extingushed'>extinguished</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_285.13'><ins class='correction' title='extingushed'>extinguished</ins></a></span> before it has consumed
and destroyed all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such is the evident meaning of this passage,
and the sense in which it must have been understood
at that time. Yet commentators, eighteen
hundred years this side of that time, presume to
turn this whole representation upside down, and
give to the terms a meaning exactly opposite
from that which they were intended to convey.
That sense alone can be the correct one in which
they were first spoken; and concerning that
there can be no question.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is another text often urged to prove the
eternal conscious misery of the wicked. It is
one in which fire is mentioned as the instrument
used for the punishment of the wicked; and this
fire being called eternal, is understood in the
same sense as the unquenchable fire of Mark 9:43.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>It may therefore properly be examined in
this connection.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>Jude 7: “Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the
cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over
to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth
for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>This text, when rightly understood, will, we
think, like that in Mark 9, be found to convey
just the opposite meaning from that popularly
given to it. The first great error in the interpretation
of this text, lies, as we view it, in a
wrong application of the tense employed. It is
claimed that the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah,
having been destroyed, were committed
to the flames of hell, where they are now (present
tense) suffering the vengeance of that eternal
fire. But a moment’s glance at the text will
show that it is the example set forth, and not the
suffering, that is in the present tense. There are
other facts mentioned in the same tense with the
suffering; thus, “giving themselves over to fornication,”
“going after strange flesh,” “suffering
the vengeance of eternal fire.” If one of these
expressions denotes something that is now going
on, the others also denote the same. If they are
now suffering the fire, they are now giving themselves
over to fornication, and going after strange
flesh; for all these declarations are in the same
construction. But no one will claim that the
Sodomites are now taking the course here described;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>neither, then, can it be claimed that
they are now suffering the pain of fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sense of the passage appears to be very
evidently this: That the Sodomites, giving themselves
up to their wicked practices, and, as a consequence,
suffering an eternal overthrow by fire
rained down upon them from heaven, are thus
set forth as an example to the ungodly of all
coming ages, of the overthrow they will also experience
if they follow the same course.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peter speaks of the same event, as an example
to the wicked, and tells what effect that fire had
upon the cities of the plain. It did not preserve
them in the midst of the fire in unceasing torture,
but turned them into ashes. He says, 2 Pet. 2:6:
“And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
into ashes, condemned them with an
overthrow, making them an ensample unto those
that after should live ungodly.” This language
is too plain to need comment. How are the
Sodomites made an example? By being overthrown
and turned into ashes for their open and
presumptuous sins. It is God saying to the
wicked of all coming time, Behold, how your
sins shall be visited unless you repent.</p>

<p class='c011'>But those fires are not now burning. Seek
out the site of those ancient and abandoned cities,
and the brackish waters of the Dead Sea will
be found rolling their sluggish waves over the
spot where once they stood. Those fires are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>therefore called eternal, because their effects are
eternal, or age-lasting. They never have recovered,
nor will they ever recover while the world
stands, from that terrible overthrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>And thus this text is very much to the purpose
on the question before us; for it declares
that the punishment of Sodom is an exact pattern
of the future punishment of the wicked;
hence that punishment will not be eternal life in
the fiery flame, but an utter consumption, even
as Sodom was consumed, by its resistless vengeance.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXI. <br /> <span class='fss'>TORMENTED FOREVER AND EVER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The only remaining texts to be urged in favor
of the eternal torment of the wicked, are two passages
which are found in the book of Revelation.
The first is Rev. 14:11: “And the smoke of their
torment ascendeth up forever and ever; and they
have no rest day nor night who worship the
beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth
the mark of his name.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is proper first to inquire of whom this is
spoken. The question before us relates to the
destiny of all the wicked. No text is therefore
conclusive on this question, which speaks of only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>a certain class, or a limited number, of the wicked;
for a particular class might for good reasons
be set apart to a certain punishment, and that
punishment be exceptional in their cases, and
not such as awaits the whole race of the guilty.
The passage just quoted speaks not of all the
wicked, but only of a limited class--the worshipers
of the beast and his image. The beast, according
to evidence which no Protestant will
be disposed to question, means the papal power;
Rev. 13:1-10; and the image is to be formed,
near the close of the career of that power. Rev.
13:14-18; 14:1-5. The text, therefore, embraces
only comparatively a small portion of the
wicked of the human race. The ancient world,
with its teeming millions, and the present heathen
world, knowing nothing of this power, are alike
exempted from the punishment here brought to
view. This text might therefore be set aside as
inconclusive, since, even if it should be admitted
to prove eternal torture for some, it does not
for all.</p>

<p class='c011'>But we claim that no text affirms eternal torment
for a single conscious intelligence in all the
universe, and hence undertake to show that this
passage does not prove it in reference to even
the limited class brought to view. The expression,
“The smoke of their torment ascendeth up
forever and ever,” is the one upon which the doctrine
of eternity of suffering is in this case suspended.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>But the same may be said of this expression
that was said in last chapter in reference
to the undying worm and the quenchless fire. It
was not new in John’s day, but was borrowed
from the Old Testament, and was one which was
well understood at that time.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Isa. 34:9, 10, the prophet, speaking of the
land of Idumea, says: “And the streams thereof
shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof
into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become
burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night
nor day: the smoke thereof shall go up forever:
from generation to generation it shall lie waste;
none shall pass through it forever and ever.”
But two applications can be made of this language.
Either it refers to the literal land of
Edom east and south of Judea, or it is a figure to
represent the whole world in the day of final
conflagration. In either case it is equally to the
point. If the literal land of Idumea is meant,
and the language has reference to the desolations
which have fallen upon it, then certainly no eternity
of duration is implied in the declaration
that the smoke thereof shall go up forever. For
all the predictions against the land of Idumea
have long since been fulfilled, and the judgments
have ceased. If it refers to the fires of the last
day, when the elements melt with fervent heat,
no eternity of duration is even then implied in
the expression; for the earth is not to be forever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>destroyed by the purifying fires of the last day.
It is to rise from its ashes, and a new earth come
forth purified from all the stains of sin, and free
from all the deformity of the curse, to be the everlasting
abode of the righteous.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here is an instance in which the word, forever,
apply it in either of the only two ways possible,
must denote a limited period. And here
the Septuagint uses αἰων (<em>aion</em>) the same as is
used in Rev. 14:11; and from this passage in
Isaiah, the language in Revelation was probably
borrowed. That the words αἰων and αἰωνιος sometimes
denote a limited period, and not invariably
one of eternal duration, will appear in the examination
of the only remaining text that calls for
consideration, namely, Rev. 20:10: “And the
devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of
fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false
prophet are, and shall be tormented day and
night forever and ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The same limitation is apparent in this text
that was observed in the preceding. It does not
refer to all the wicked, but speaks only of the
devil, the beast, and the false prophet. The lake
of fire, the place and means of their torment, is
again mentioned in verse 14; but there it is the
symbol of complete and utter destruction. Death
and Hades, it says, were cast into the lake of
fire, and after this it is said, “There shall be no
more death.” Rev. 21:4. Whatever, then, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>cast into the lake of fire, after it has wrought its
work of destruction upon them, no longer exists.
This is the plain inference from what is here asserted
respecting death. Then follows the testimony
of verse 15, that “whosoever was not found
written in the book of life, was cast into the lake
of fire.” And this makes a final disposition of
all who are not saved in the kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is nothing in the way of this application,
unless the words “forever and ever” denote absolutely
an eternity of duration. These words
are translated in the New Testament from <em>aion</em>,
and <em>aionios</em>, respecting which the following facts
may be stated.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Aion</em> is defined by different lexicographers as
follows:--</p>

<p class='c011'>Greenfield: “Duration, finite or infinite, unlimited
duration, eternity; a period of duration
past or future, time, age, lifetime; the world, universe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Schrevelius: “An age, a long period of time;
indefinite duration; time, whether longer or
shorter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Liddell and Scott: “A space or period of
time, especially a lifetime, life, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ævum</em></span>; an age,
a generation; long space of time, eternity; in
plural, <em>eis tous aionas ton aionon</em>, unto ages of
ages, forever and ever, N. T., Gal. 1:5.-3. later,
a space of time clearly defined and marked out,
an era, age, period of a dispensation: <em>ho aion
houtos</em>, this present life, this world.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Parkhurst: “Always being. It denotes duration
or continuance of time, but with great variety.
I. Both in the singular and the plural it
signifies eternity, whether past or to come. II.
The duration of this world. III. The ages of
the world. IV. This present life. V. The world
to come. VI. An age, period, or periodical dispensation
of divine providence. VII. <em>Aiones</em>
seems, in Heb. 11:3, to denote the various revolutions
and grand occurrences which have happened
in this created system, including also the
world itself. Comp. Heb. 1:2, and Macknight
on both texts. <em>Aion</em>, in the LXX. generally answers
to the Hebrew <em>holam</em>, which denotes <em>time
hidden</em> from man, whether indefinite or definite,
whether past or future.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Robinson: “Duration, the course or flow of
time in various relations as determined by the
context, viz: (A) For human life, existence. (B)
For time indefinite, a period of the world, the
world, in Gr. writers, and also in Sept. and N.
Testament. (C) For endless duration, perpetuity,
eternity.... Sept. mostly for Heb. <em>holam</em>,
‘hidden time,’ duration, eternity.--Hence, in N.
T. of long-continued time, indefinite duration, in
accordance with Greek usage, but modified as to
construction and extent by the example of the
LXX., and the Rabbinic views.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Schleusner gives as the first meaning of <em>aion</em>,
“a definite and long-continued time,” <em>i. e.</em>, a long-continued
but still a definite period of time.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Wahl has arranged the definitions of <em>aion</em>
thus: “(1) Time, unlimited duration, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ævum</em></span>. (2)
The universe, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>mundus</em></span>. (3) An age, period of
the world,” as the Jewish age, Christian age, &amp;c.
This reference to Schleusner and Wahl we find in
Stuart on Future Punishment, pp. 91, 93.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Holam</em>, the Hebrew word which corresponds
to the Greek <em>aion</em>, is applied according to Gesenius
to things which endure for a long time, for
an indefinite period. It is applied to the Jewish
priesthood, to the Mosaic ordinances, to the possession
of the land of Canaan, to the hills and
mountains, to the earth, to the time of service to
be rendered by a slave, and to some other things
of a like nature. Stuart, p. 72.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cruden, in his Unabridged Concordance, under
the word eternal, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The words, eternal, everlasting, and forever, are
sometimes taken for a long time, and are not always to be
understood strictly. Thus, ‘Thou shalt be our guide from
this time forth even <a id='corr294.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='forever,”'>forever,’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_294.21'><ins class='correction' title='forever,”'>forever,’</ins></a></span> that is, during our whole
life. And in many other places of Scripture, and in particular
when the word forever is applied to the Jewish
rites and privileges, it commonly signifies no more than
during the standing of that commonwealth, until the
coming of the Messiah.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Clarke places in our hands a key to the interpretation
of the words, “forever” and “forever
and ever,” which is adapted to every instance of
their use. According to his rule they are to be
taken to mean as long as a thing, considering the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>surrounding circumstances, can exist. And he
illustrates this in his closing remarks on 2 Kings
5, where, speaking of the curse of the leprosy
pronounced upon Gehazi forever, he says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Some have thought, because of the prophet’s curse,
‘The leprosy of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and to thy
seed forever,’ that there are persons still alive who are
this man’s descendants, and afflicted with this horrible
disease. Mr. Maundrell, when he was in Judea, made
diligent inquiry concerning this, but could not ascertain
the truth of the supposition. To me it appears absurd;
the denunciation took place in the posterity of Gehazi
till it should become extinct; and under the influence of
this disorder, this must <em>soon</em> have taken place. The <em>forever</em>
implies as long as any of his posterity should remain.
This is the import of the word, <em>leolam</em>. <em>It takes in the
whole extent or duration of the thing to which it is applied.</em>
The <em>forever</em> of Gehazi was till his posterity became extinct.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The word <em>aionios</em> is derived from <em>aion</em>, and
its general meaning may be determined from the
definitions given above to the latter word.</p>

<p class='c011'>That these words are frequently applied to
the existence of divine beings, and the future
happiness of the saints, is true; and that in these
cases they denote eternal duration is equally evident;
yet, according to the definition of the
words and the rule laid down by Dr. Clarke, that
eternal duration could not be made out by the
use of these words alone. They denote duration
or continuance of time, the length of that duration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>being determined by the nature of the objects
to which they are applied. When applied
to things which we know from other declarations
of the Scriptures are to have no end, they signify
an eternity of being; but when applied to things
which are to end, they are correspondingly limited
in their meaning. That the existence of
God and the future happiness of the righteous
are to be absolutely eternal, we are abundantly
assured by scriptures which make no use of the
words in question. When applied to these they
therefore signify a period of duration which is
never to end. Just as plainly are we assured
that the existence of the wicked is at last to
cease in the second death; and when applied to
this, the words <em>aion</em> and <em>aionios</em> must be limited
accordingly in their signification. Overlooking
this plain principle of interpretation, Prof. Stuart,
p. 89, comes to this erroneous conclusion respecting
these words, because they are applied
alike to the sufferings of the lost and the happiness
of the saved, that “we must either admit
the endless misery of hell, or give up the endless
happiness of Heaven.” We are under no such
necessity. The words, <em>aion</em> and <em>aionios</em>, according
to Dr. Clarke, cover the whole of the existence
of the two classes in their respective
spheres, and that only. The one is, after a season
of suffering and anguish, to come to an end;
the other is to go on in bliss to all eternity.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>So when it is said that the beast and the false
prophet, and they who worship the beast and his
image, are to be tormented day and night forever
and ever, we must understand this expression to
cover only the duration of their future existence
beyond the grave. If we are anywhere given
to understand by other scriptures and by other
terms which are more rigid in their meaning,
that this is to be eternal, the terms must here
be so understood; if not, we have no warrant for
so defining them here.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the forever and ever, <em>eis tous aionas ton
aionon</em>, of the suffering of the wicked, denotes
a period of long duration, there is no question;
and it may be much longer than any have been
disposed to conceive who deny its eternity; yet
it is to come to an end, not by their restoration
to God’s favor, but by the extinction of that life
which has in it no immortality, and because they
have refused to accept of the life freely offered
to them, which is to continue through ages without
end.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have now examined all the more prominent
passages which are urged in favor of the eternal
suffering of the lost. Though others may by
some be brought forward to prove this doctrine,
we may safely take the position that if it is not
proved by those we have examined, it cannot be
proved by any in all the Bible; for these use the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>strongest terms and are most explicit in their
nature. And of these how many are there? Five
in all. Those who have never before examined
this subject, will perhaps be surprised to learn
how small is the number of such texts. And
should they take into the account every text
which is thought to have even the slightest semblance
of proving the immortality of the lost, it
would not be calculated to abate that surprise
to any great degree.</p>

<p class='c011'>It now remains that we examine those texts,
more in number, and more explicit in statement,
which prove that the wicked shall be at last as
though they had not been.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXII. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE END OF THEM THAT OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c010'>“What shall the end be of them that obey not the
gospel of God?” 1 Pet. 4:17.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>By this direct interrogation inspiration calls us
face to face to the great question of the final
destiny of the lost, not to leave us at last in perplexity
and doubt, but to give us full information
in reference thereto.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>By the foregoing examination of themes which
have a bearing upon this question, we have been
brought to a place where the way is all clear to
listen unbiased to the direct testimony of the
Bible on the point now before us. No immortality
is anywhere affirmed of the soul, no eternal
misery is anywhere threatened against the lost.
What then is to be their fate? It is abundantly
affirmed that they shall die.</p>

<p class='c011'>The inquiry into the nature of the death
threatened Adam, in chapter xxv., brought very
clearly to view the fact that the penalty pronounced
upon his sin reduced back to the dust
the entire being, leaving no part conscious and
active in the intermediate state. And the same
penalty stands against sin now as at the beginning.
For our personal sins, death is now threatened
against us, as it was against him. This is
the second death; and those who fall under this
will be reduced to the same condition as that
into which Adam was brought by death, with no
promise nor possibility of ever being released
therefrom.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>Eze. 18:26: “When a righteous man turneth away
from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and
dieth <em>in</em> them; <em>for</em> his iniquity that he hath done shall he
die.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Two deaths are here brought to view: First,
the death common to this state of being, which
all share alike, good and bad, which is called the
first, or temporal, death; secondly, if a person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>dies this death in a state of sin, that is, with sins
upon him of which he does not repent before he
dies, <em>for</em> those sins that he has committed he
shall die. Another death awaits him. The first
death was not for his personal transgressions;
for this is entailed upon all alike through Adam,
both good and bad. But every one is to die for
his own sins unless he repents. How is this to
be brought about? He is to be raised from the
first death and judged; and, if sins are then
found upon him, for those sins he suffers the
same penalty, death; and being thus reduced to
death again, he will forever remain dead; for
from this death there is no release nor redemption
provided. This is the second death, and is
the everlasting punishment in store for all the
workers of iniquity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paul says, Rom. 6:23, “The wages of sin is
death;” and James (1:15) corroborates this
testimony, by saying, “Sin, when it is finished,
bringeth forth death.” In Rom. 2, Paul tells us
of certain characters which are certainly deserving,
if any can be, of eternal torture; but, in
passing sentence upon them, he does not draw
out before us a picture of unending conscious
misery, a course for which he has the most appropriate
occasion, if it be true, but only tells us,
in accordance with reason as well as revelation,
that they are worthy of <em>death</em>. But death is a
state which can be reached only on a complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>extinction of life. As long as there is any life
about a man, he is not dead. “The death that
never dies,” is a contradiction of terms. Nor can
a person properly be said to be dying, unless he
is tending to a state of death, which he will by
and by reach. And yet the popular view of this
subject is well expressed in the following language
of Thomas Vincent:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The torments of hell will not be in one part only, but
in every part, not in a weaker degree, but in the greatest
extremity; not for a day, or a month, or a year, but forever:
the wicked will be always dying, never dead; the
pangs of death will ever be upon them, and yet they
shall never give up the ghost; if they could die they
would think themselves happy; they will always be roaring,
and never breathe out their last; always sinking, and
never come to the bottom; always burning in those
flames, and never consumed; the eternity of hell will be
the hell of hell.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Again, the Lord says, speaking of a certain
class of his enemies, “For yet a little while and
the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in
their destruction.” Isa. 10:25. This is conclusive
testimony that all those with whom the
Lord has occasion to be angry, as he is with all
the wicked, Ps. 7:11, will be finally destroyed,
and in that destruction his anger toward them
will cease. Yet the majority of divines tell us
that God’s “fiery indignation and incensed fury”
toward them will never cease; that he will never
literally destroy them, but will forever torment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>them, and keep them alive expressly that he may
torment them. Says Benson:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“He will exert <em>all</em> his divine attributes to make them
as wretched as the capacity of their nature will admit.”
And he continues, “They must be perpetually swelling
their enormous sums of guilt, and still running deeper,
immensely deeper, in debt to divine and infinite justice.
Hence after the longest imaginable period, they will be so
far from having discharged their debt that they will find
more due than when they first began to suffer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Thus the sinner is represented as being able
to distance in sin the power of Omnipotence to
punish. They go on accumulating loads of guilt
in their rebellion against the divine government,
while God, exerting <em>all</em> his divine attributes, follows
tardily after, in fruitless efforts to make the
terrors of his punishment adequate to the infinitude
of their guilt. Oh, horrid picture of perverted
imagination! Did we not believe its
authors labored under the sincere conviction that
they were doing God service, and did we not
know that many good and estimable persons still
defend the doctrine under an earnest, though
mistaken, zeal for God, it would deserve to be
styled the most arrant blasphemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>This condition of the finally reprobate, so often
and so distinctly defined as a state of death, is
also set forth by very many other expressions, by
every variety of phrase, in fact, which expresses,
in the most complete and absolute manner, an
utter loss of existence.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Henry Constable, A. M., in his work on “The
Duration and Nature of Future Punishment,” p.
12, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“But it is not only by this phrase, ‘death,’ that the
Old Testament describes the punishment of the ungodly.
By every expression in the Hebrew language, significant
of loss of life, loss of existence, the resolution of organized
substance into its original parts, its reduction to that
condition in which it is as though it had never been
called into being--by every such expression does the Old
Testament describe the end of the ungodly. ‘The destruction
of the transgressors and the sinners shall be
together:’ ‘prepare them for the <em>day of slaughter</em>:’ ‘<em>the
slain</em> of the Lord shall be many:’ ‘they shall go forth and
look upon <em>the carcasses</em> of the men that have sinned:’ ‘God
shall <em>destroy</em> them:’ ‘they shall be <em>consumed</em>:’ ‘they shall
be <em>cut off</em>:’ ‘they shall be rooted <em>out of the land of the
living</em>:’ ‘<em>blotted out of the book of life</em>:’‘<em>they are not</em>.’
The Hebrew scholar will see from the above passages that
there is no phrase of the Hebrew language significant of
all destruction short of that philosophical annihilation of
elements which we do not assert, which is not used to
denote the end of the ungodly.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><em>The wicked shall be destroyed.</em> “The Lord
preserveth all them that love him; but all the
wicked will he destroy.” Ps. 145:20. Here
preservation is promised only to those who love
God, and in opposition to this, <em>destruction</em> is
threatened to the wicked. But human wisdom
teaches us that God will preserve the wicked in
hell--preserve them for the mere sake of torturing
them. Mr. Benson again says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“God is therefore present in hell to see the punishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>of these rebels. His fiery indignation kindles, and
his incensed fury feeds the flame of their torment, while
his powerful presence and operation <em>maintains their being</em>,
and renders their powers most acutely sensible, thus setting
the keenest edge upon their pain, and making it cut
most intolerably deep.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><em>The wicked shall perish.</em> “For God so loved
the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not <em>perish</em>,
but have everlasting life.” John 3:16. A
double enunciation of the truth is couched in this
short text. It is that eternal life is to be obtained
only through Christ, and that all who do
not thus obtain it will eventually perish. John
testifies further on the same point in his 1st
epistle, 5:11: “And this is the record: that God
hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his
Son.” From which it follows, as a most natural
consequence, that “he that hath not the Son of
God <em>hath not life</em>.” Verse 12.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>The wicked shall go to perdition.</em> “We are
not of them who draw back unto perdition, but
of them that believe to the saving of the soul.”
Heb. 10:39. We either gain the salvation of
our souls by a perseverance in faith, and obtain
eternal life by a patient continuance in well-doing,
Rom. 2:7, or we sink back into perdition,
which, is defined to be utter ruin, or <em>destruction</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>The wicked shall come to an end and be as
though they had not been.</em>” “For yet a little
while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>shalt diligently consider his place, and <em>it</em> shall not
be.” Ps. 37:10. If this testimony be true, there
will be neither a sinner nor any <em>place</em> for a sinner,
after God has executed upon them his just
judgments. “They shall be as though they had
not been.” Obad. 16.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reader is requested to mark the significance
of these texts. They are not figures, but
plain enunciations of truth, demanding to be understood
in the plainest and most literal manner.
And though they are so abundant, and can be so
easily produced, they are not to be passed over
any more lightly on this account.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>The wicked are compared to the most inflammable
and perishable substances.</em> Had the
wicked been compared to the most durable
substances with which we are acquainted in
nature; had they been likened to the “everlasting
hills,” the during rock, or the precious metals,
gold and gems, the most incorruptible of all substances;
such comparisons would not have been
without their weight in giving us an idea of an
eternity of existence; nor can we think they
would have been overlooked by the other side.
We therefore claim an equal significance on our
side of the question for the fact that they are
everywhere compared to just the opposite of the
above-named substances--substances the most
perishable and corruptible of any that exist.
For no idea can be drawn from such comparisons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>at all compatible with the idea of eternal preservation
in the midst of glowing and devouring
fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus it is said of the wicked that they shall
be dashed in pieces like a potter’s vessel, Ps. 2:9,
they shall be like the beasts that perish, Ps.
49:20, like the untimely fruit of a woman, Ps.
58:8, like a whirlwind that passeth away, Ps.
68:2; Prov. 10:25, like a waterless garden
scorched by an eastern sun, Isa. 1:30, like garments
consumed by the moth, Isa. 51:8, like the
thistle down scattered by the whirlwind, Isa. 17:13,
margin. They shall consume like the fat of
lambs in the fire, Ps. 37:20, consume into smoke
(<em>ibid.</em>), and ashes, Mal. 4:3, melt like wax, Ps.
68:2, burn like tow, Isa. 1:31, consume like
thorns, Isa. 34:12, vanish away like exhausted
waters, Ps. 58:7.</p>

<p class='c011'>The illustrations which the New Testament
uses to represent the destiny of the wicked are
of exactly the same nature. They are likened to
chaff, which is to be burned entirely up, Matt. 3:12,
tares to be consumed, Matt. 13:40, withered
branches to be burned, John 15:6, bad fish cast
away to corruption, Matt. 13:47, 48, a house
thrown down to its foundations, Luke 6:49, to
the destruction of the old world by water, Luke
17:27, to the destruction of the Sodomites by fire,
verse 29, 2 Pet. 2:5, 6, and to natural brute beasts,
that perish in their own corruption. Verse 12.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Such are the illustrations of the Scriptures on
this subject. If the wicked are to be tormented
forever, all these illustrations are not only unnatural,
but false; for in that case they are not
like the perishing beasts, the passing whirlwind,
the moth-consumed garment, the burning fat,
the vanishing smoke, or the melting wax; nor
like chaff, tares, and withered branches, consumed
and reduced to ashes. These all lose their form
and substance, and become as though they had
not been; but this the wicked never do, according
to the popular view. There is an enormous
contradiction somewhere. Is it between the
writers of the Bible? or between uninspired
men and the word of God? The trouble is not
with the Bible; all is harmony there. The discrepancy
arises from the creeds and theories of
men.</p>

<p class='c011'>The language of Moses and of Paul shows that
an eternal existence of moral corruption and
fiery torture is not the doom of the wicked.
When Moses besought the Lord to forgive the
sin of Israel, he said, “Yet now, if thou wilt forgive
their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee,
out of thy book which thou hast written.” Ex.
32:32. This book must be the book of life, in
which the names of the righteous are written.
By being blotted out of this book, Moses evidently
meant being devoted to the doom of sinners.
If Israel could not be forgiven, he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>himself perish with that unfaithful people. But
no one can for a moment suppose that he wished
throughout eternity for a life of sin, pain, and
blasphemy, in hell. He only wished for an utter
cessation of that life which, if his prayer could
not be granted, would be an intolerable burden.
And if this is what he meant by being blotted
out of God’s book, it follows that this will be the
doom of the ungodly; for the Lord answered,
“Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I
blot out of my book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In a similar manner, Paul speaks concerning
the same people: “For I could wish that myself
were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my
kinsmen according to the flesh.” Rom. 9:3. We
cannot suppose that Paul would desire a life of
sin and moral corruption, such as that of the sinner
in hell is said to be, even for the sake of his
people. But he was willing to give up his life
for them, and cease to exist, if thereby they
might be saved.</p>

<p class='c011'>To notice more particularly some of the scriptures
in which a portion of the foregoing figures
are found, their testimony may be summed up in
the following final proposition:--</p>

<p class='c011'><em>The wicked shall be consumed and devoured
by fire.</em> “Woe unto them that call evil good, and
good evil; that put darkness for light, and light
for darkness,” &amp;c. “Therefore as the fire devoureth
the stubble, and the flame consumeth the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and
their blossom shall go up as dust”! Isa. 5:20-24.
Reader, have you ever seen fire devour
stubble, or flame consume chaff? Then you
have seen a figure of the destruction of the
wicked. And let the advocate of eternal misery
tell us, if such language does not denote the utter
consumption of the wicked, what language would
do it, if the doctrine were true. Let us know
what language Inspiration should have used, had
it wished to convey such an idea. Is it such as
this? “But the wicked shall perish, and the
enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs;
they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume
away.” Ps. 37:20. “And they went up
on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the
camp of the saints about, and the beloved city:
and fire came down from God out of heaven, and
<em>devoured</em> them.” The word here rendered devour,
κατέφαγεν, says Stuart, is “intensive, to <em>eat
up, devour</em>, so that it denotes utter excision.”
In the light of this scripture, we can readily
understand how it is that the wicked are to be
recompensed in the earth. Prov. 11:31. Coming
up in the second resurrection, at the end of
the 1000 years of Rev. 20:5, they come up
around the New Jerusalem, the beloved city, the
abode of the saints, then descended from Heaven
to earth, chap. 21:5, and then their fearful retribution
overtakes them. It is then that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>have their portion in those purifying fires that
sweep over the earth, in which, according to
Peter’s testimony, the elements of this great
globe itself shall melt with fervent heat. 2 Pet.
3:10, 12. For it is at the day of Judgment (by
which of course we must understand the execution
of the Judgment) and perdition of ungodly
men that this takes place. See verse 7. So,
too, the righteous, as they go forth upon the
new earth, verse 13, destined to be their eternal
and glorious abode, will receive their recompense
in the earth. Then will be fulfilled the word of
the Lord by the prophet Malachi, which says,
“For behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as
an oven: and all the proud, yea, and all that do
wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that
cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of
hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
branch. But unto you that fear my name,
shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing
in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and
grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall
tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes
under the soles of your feet in the day that I
shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts.” Mark the
distinctness of this language. It does not say
that the wicked shall be <em>as</em> ashes, nor does it introduce
any comparison here whatever, but plainly
states a plain fact, that they <em>shall be ashes</em>, under
the soles of the saints’ feet. Not that the saints
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>will literally walk on ashes, but the wicked, having
been reduced to ashes, like all other sin-and-curse-polluted
things, are incorporated into the
substance of the new earth, which the saints are
evermore to inhabit, as it emerges from the renovating
fires of the last day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then will the universe be clean and pure.
Then the stain of sin will all be wiped away
forever; sinners, and the great enemy that deceived
them (for he, too, shall be destroyed, Heb.
2:14), being rooted out of the land of the
living. Its every scar now impressed upon the
handiwork of God shall be effaced; and this unfortunate
earth shall be re-adorned, as only God,
omnipotent in power and omniscient in wisdom,
is able to adorn it. And then will arise that
glad anthem of universal Jubilee, in which shall
join <em>every creature</em> which is in Heaven, and on
the earth, and under the earth, and such as are
in the sea, ascribing blessing, and honor, and
glory, and power, unto him that sitteth on the
throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.
Rev. 5:13. There is no room here for a great
receptacle of fiery torment, where an innumerable
company of human beings shall burn and
blaspheme and sin and suffer forever and ever.
There is no room in this great song of joy for the
discordant and hopeless wailing of the damned.
There is no provision made for an eternal rebellion
against the government of God, and eternal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>blasphemy against his holy name! No! only
the loyal subjects of the great Captain of our
salvation, only such as love immortal life, and
seek for it, and prepare themselves for its inestimable
blessings, shall ever enjoy the glorious
boon; while those who put from themselves the
word of God, and “judge themselves unworthy of
everlasting life,” Acts 13:46, will be remanded
back to the original elements from which they
sprung; and strict Justice will write upon their
unhonored and unlamented graves that they
themselves were the arbiters of their own fate.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXIII. <br /> <span class='fss'>GOD’S DEALINGS WITH HIS CREATURES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?”
asked an eminent servant of God in the opening
pages of revelation, Gen. 18:25; and when all is
finished, the redeemed, looking over all God’s
dealings with man, exclaim with fervent lips,
“Just and true are thy ways, thou King of
saints.” Rev. 15:3. It is objected that we
should raise no question regarding the justness
of the doom to which God may devote any portion
of our race; because we are not able to judge
of his ways. Of things with which we are imperfectly
acquainted, or which are above our comprehension,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>this is undoubtedly true; but respecting
our relation to God, the light in which he
looks upon sin, and the disposition he will finally
make of it, he says to us, “Come, let us reason.”
We are never called upon to form an opinion or
a decision in regard to things respecting which
we are incapable of judging; but we are called
upon to reverence God, as a God of love, wisdom,
justice, and mercy. We must, therefore, be capable
of judging of his character, his mercy, his
love, his wisdom, and his justice. Are these
characteristics displayed in his future dealings
with the wicked, according to the view generally
promulgated by the churches of the present day?
The question to be decided is this: Is an eternity
of torture so intense that the severest pain
a person can suffer on earth is but a faint shadow
of it, any <em>just punishment</em> for any conceivable
amount of sin committed by the worst of men,
during the brief period of our mortal life? What
is our present life? Something for which we did
not ask; something given us without our knowledge
or consent; and, in the forcible language of
another, “Can any abuse of this unasked-for gift
justify the recompense of an existence spent in
unending agony?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the sins committed in this finite life,
and the fiery torment of hell continued through
numberless millions of ages, and then no nearer
its end than when the first groan was uttered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>there is a disproportion so infinite, that few attempt
to rest that eternal misery on merely the
sins of the present life; and they endeavor to
vindicate God’s justice in the matter, or at least
to apologize for his course, by saying that the
sinner continues to sin, and that is the reason
why he continues to suffer. The guilt of all the
sins done in the body is soon expiated in the
fiery flame; but then they must suffer for the
sins committed after they left this mortal state,
and commenced their life of agony in hell. And
here they are represented as sinning faster than
the inconceivable woe of hell can punish. It is
affirmed of them, as quoted from Benson in the
previous chapter, that “they must be perpetually
swelling their enormous sums of guilt, and still
running deeper, immensely deeper, in debt to divine
and infinite justice. Hence, after the longest
imaginable period, they will be so far from
having discharged their debt that they will find
more due than when they first began to suffer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In like manner Wm. Archer Butler, in his
sermon on Future Punishment, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The punishments of hell are but the perpetual vengeance
that accompanies the sins of hell. An eternity of
wickedness brings with it an eternity of woe. The sinner
is to suffer for everlasting, but it is because the sin itself
is as everlasting as the suffering.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Do the Scriptures anywhere thus speak? Do
they not affirm, not once or twice, but over and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>over again, that the punishment of the future
is for the sins of the present time? It is for
the sins in which the sinner dies, not for what
he commits after death, that he is to suffer future
retribution. Eze. 18:26. The works for which
we are to be brought into judgment (and for no
others can we be punished) are the works of this
present life. Eccl. 12:14. And Paul testifies,
“For we must all appear before the judgment
seat of Christ, that every one may receive the
things <em>done in his body</em>, according to that he
hath done, whether it be good or bad.” 2 Cor.
5:10. It is for the sins done by human beings
in the body, in this present life, not for what
they will commit as lost spirits in hell, that they
are to answer at the judgment seat of Christ, and
for which they are to receive a just retribution.
And if everlasting misery is thought to be too
much for this, we are not at liberty to throw in
<em>post-mortem</em> sins to balance the excessive punishment.
If eternal torment cannot be defended
as a just punishment for the sins of this present
life, it cannot be defended at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>To illustrate: Suppose in an earthly tribunal
the judge should sentence a criminal to a punishment
altogether too severe for the crime of
which he had been guilty, and then should endeavor
to justify his course by saying that he
gave the sentence because he knew that the
criminal would deserve it by the sins he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>commit after he went to jail! How long would
such a judge be tolerated? Yet this is the very
course attributed by learned doctors of divinity,
to the Judge of all the earth, who has declared
that he will do right.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the supposition that eternal torture is to
be inflicted as the penalty for a life of sin in this
world, were man asked if God’s conduct in this
respect was just, his own innate sense of justice,
not yet wholly obliterated by the fall, would
prompt him to a universal and determined, No!
The framers of different religious systems have
felt this, and seem to have searched sharply for
some avenue of escape from the fearful wrong
of this horrid theory. So Plato had his Acherusian
lake from which at least some of the wretched
sufferers in Tartarus, after a purgative process
might issue forth again to the upper air. Augustine
following Plato in his notion of an abode
of unending pain for some, had also his purgatory
from whence others might find a road to
Heaven. Rome has only a purgatory, the fires
of a finite period, for the millions within her
communion. Origen conceived of a purgatory
wider than Plato’s, Augustine’s, or Rome’s, from
which all should at length be restored to the favor
of God.</p>

<p class='c011'>The churches of the Reformation have generally
accepted of Augustine’s hell, but denied his
purgatory. In the Protestant denominations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>therefore, we have this doctrine in its most horrid
aspects. And it is no marvel that many who
have felt compelled by their creed to accept it,
have shrunk from its advocacy, and have tacitly,
if not openly, confessed that they could heartily
wish it were a lie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Saurin at the close of one of his sermons thus
speaks:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“I sink, I sink, under the awful weight of my subject;
and I declare, when I see my friends, my relations, the
people of my charge,--this whole congregation, when I
think that I, that you, that we are all exposed to these
torments; when I see in the lukewarmness of my <a id='corr317.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic: devotions'>devosions</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_317.13'><ins class='correction' title='sic: devotions'>devosions</ins></a></span>,
in the langour of my love, in the levity of my resolutions
and designs, the least evidence, though it be only
possible or presumptive, of my future misery, I find in
the thought a mortal poison, that diffuseth itself through
every period of my existence, rendering society tiresome,
nourishment insipid, pleasure disgustful, <em>and life itself a
cruel bitter</em>. I cease to wonder that the fear of hell hath
made some <em>melancholy</em>, others <em>mad</em>; that it hath disposed
some to expose themselves to a living martyrdom, by
fleeing from all commerce with the rest of mankind, and
others, to suffer the most terrible, violent torments.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Albert Barnes, the well-known preacher and
commentator, speaks on the same point as follows:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“I confess when I look upon a world of sinners and of
sufferers; upon death-beds and grave-yards, upon the
world of woe filled with hosts to suffer forever; when I
see my friends, my parents, my family, my people, my
fellow-citizens; when I look upon a whole race all involved
in this sin and danger, and when I see the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>mass of them wholly unconcerned, and when I feel that
God only can save them, and yet he does not do it--I am
struck dumb. It is all dark, dark, dark to my soul, and
I cannot disguise it.”--<cite>Sermons</cite>, pp. 124, 125.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Such is the effect of the doctrine of eternal
misery with some, according to the confession of
its own advocates. No one can say that such
effects are either good or desirable. And why
does it not have this effect upon more? We answer,
it is because the lips only mechanically assent
to what the heart and reason either will not
try to realize, or else do not seriously believe.
Says Bishop Newton:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Imagine a creature, nay, imagine numberless creatures
produced out of nothing ... delivered over to torments
of endless ages, without the least hope or possibility
of relaxation or redemption. Imagine it you may,
but you can never seriously believe it, nor reconcile it to
God and goodness.”--<cite>Dissertation</cite>, No. 60.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>But the majority are affected by it far differently.
Every better emotion of their nature revolts
at the idea, and they will not accept it.
They cannot believe that God is thus cruel, tyrannical,
revengeful, implacable; the personification,
in short, of every trait of character which,
when seen in men here, we consider unmistakable
marks of debasement and degradation; and believing
the Bible and Christianity to be identified
with such teaching as this, with equal promptness
they too are rejected and cast away. But here
we need not enlarge. Probably no one will read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>these lines under whose observation some case
has not come of persons driven into skepticism,
yes, driven and held there, by the popular doctrine
of eternal misery--a doctrine which has
been well described by a Christian writer, as “a
theology that is confused, entangled, imperfect,
and gloomy; a theology which, while it abundantly
breeds infidelity among the educated classes,
fails to spread through the body of the population,
and but dimly, or only as a flickering candle
enlightens the world.”--<cite>I. Taylor.</cite></p>

<p class='c011'>But how is it with the view we have tried to
present? Quite the reverse, as our own observation
proves. Instances have come under our immediate
knowledge of persons who, when they
saw the divine harmony of God’s system of government,
as brought to view in his word, when
they saw the just and reasonable disposition
which the Bible declares that he will make of all
those who will persist in rebellion against him,--a
disposition in which justice and mercy so beautifully
blend, have been able to take that Bible
and say for the first time in their life they could
believe it to be the book of God. And believing
this, they have been led to turn their feet into its
testimonies, and strive by obedience to its plain
requirements to escape a doom which they could
see to be just, and therefore knew to be certain.
This has been the experience of many. Let, then,
the impression no longer exist, and the assertion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>no more be made, that these views tend to irreligion
and infidelity. Their fruits everywhere
show just the reverse.</p>

<p class='c011'>Can it then be wondered at that we should be
solicitous to disabuse the minds of the people in
this respect? Shall we not have a zeal for the
Lord, and be untiring in our efforts to wipe off
from the book and character of God the aspersions
which are by this doctrine cast upon them?
God represents himself to his creatures by the
endearing name of Love; he declares that he is
very pitiful and of tender mercy, long-suffering
and slow to anger, not hasty to execute sentence
against an evil work, not gratified in any manner
by the death of the wicked, and not willing that
any should perish; he declares that he delighteth
in mercy, that he will not contend forever,
neither be always wroth. And can it be that
while thus representing himself to the inhabitants
of earth, he was kindling fiery torture on
multitudes of wretched beings in the dreary regions
of hell, feeding their flame with his incensed
fury, preserving and tormenting them in
infinite indignation, exerting all his divine <a id='corr320.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='attritributes'>attributes</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_320.24'><ins class='correction' title='attritributes'>attributes</ins></a></span>
to make them as wretched as the capacity
of their nature would admit, and maintaining
a fixed purpose to do this through the endless
ages of eternity! If not, “what a portentous error
must it be!” How fearfully is his character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>misrepresented! What a bold and audacious libel
is uttered against his holy name!</p>

<p class='c011'>The root and trunk of all this, is the “taken-for-granted”
position that the soul is immortal.
But search through your Bible and see if you find
it so. See if you will not rather be prepared to
exclaim with the eminent commentator, Olshausen,
that “the doctrine of the ‘immortality of the
soul,’ and the name, are <em>alike unknown to the entire
Bible</em>.” (Comment on 1 Cor. 15:19, 20.) See
if you can find the death that never dies, and
never-dying soul. If not, we ask you to reject
the idea at once as a most dangerous and destructive
error. Men are thus rejecting it. The
leaven is working in the public mind. Men are
growing suspicious of the truth of a declaration,
first uttered by a not over-truthful character in
Eden, perpetuated thence through heathenism,
and at last through the medium of the mother of
harlots, disseminated through all the veins and
channels of Orthodoxy. But truth will work its
way up, however deeply the rubbish may have
been heaped upon it; and before the bright rising
of its light, all antiquated superstitions and
traditionary dogmas, will lie exposed in their native
deformity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXIV. <br /> <span class='fss'>THE CLAIMS OF PHILOSOPHY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>After the Bible, what? When once the word
of God pronounces upon a question, what further
evidence is needed to sustain the position, or
what evidence is strong enough to break its decision?
What can human reason, science, and
philosophy, do for a theory upon which the
Scriptures have written “Ichabod”?</p>

<p class='c011'>We have, in previous chapters, examined the
teaching of the Bible on the whole subject of
man’s creation, nature, death, intermediate state,
and final doom. We have found that man was
not created absolutely mortal or immortal, but
relatively both: immortality was within his
reach, and mortality lay as a danger in his path.
He sinned and became absolutely mortal. Then
death becomes an unconscious sleep in the grave,
and his destiny beyond the tomb, if he does not
secure through Christ, eternal life, is an utter loss
of existence. But there are some who think that
reason, science, and philosophy, are sufficient to
disprove these conclusions; or, at least, that they
are so strong that the Bible record must be made
to harmonize with the claims drawn from these
sources. But they forget that much that we call
reason is in the sight of God “foolishness,” that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>there is a philosophy which the Bible pronounces
“vain,” and some kinds of science which it
says are “falsely so called.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We are willing to grant philosophy the privilege
of trying to substantiate its claims. It may
boast like Goliah, but it will be found weaker
than Belshazzar before the handwriting on the
wall.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>The soul immortal.</em> It is claimed that the soul
is immaterial, and cannot therefore be destroyed,
and hence must be immortal. Luther Lee says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“If God himself has made the soul immaterial, he cannot
destroy it by bringing material agents to act upon it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>This claim is good if whatever is indestructible
is immortal. But this is a manifest error.
The elements of the human body are indestructible,
but the body is not therefore immortal. It
is subject to change, death, and decay. But if it
is claimed that the soul, being immaterial, is
without elements, then perhaps it might follow
that it is indestructible; for that which is nothing
can never be made less than nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the soul of man, being immaterial, is
thus proved to be immortal, what shall we say
of the souls of the lower orders of animals? for
they manifest the phenomena of mind as well as
men. They remember, fear, imagine, compare,
manifest gratitude, anger, sorrow, desire, &amp;c.
Bishop Warburton says:--</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“I think it may be strictly demonstrated that man has
an immaterial soul; <em>but then</em>, the same arguments which
prove <em>that</em>, prove, likewise, that the souls of all living animals
are immaterial.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Whoever, therefore, affirms the immortality of
man from the immateriality of his soul, is bound
to affirm the same, not only of the nobler animals,
but also of all the lower orders of the brute
creation. Here, believers in natural immortality
are crushed beneath the weight of their own arguments.
If it be said that God can, if he choose,
blot from existence the immaterial soul of the
beetle and the titmouse, we reply, so can he that
of man; and then its immortality is at an end,
and the whole argument is abandoned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Matter cannot think.</em>” This is the fundamental
proposition on which the airy phantom
of the immortality of the soul relies for its support.
Since man does think, and matter cannot
think, the mind or soul must be immaterial
and immortal. It is one thing to make such
an assertion; it is quite another thing to prove
it; and the proof lies not within the power
of man. That mind, like electricity, may be a
property of matter, or result from material causes,
Sidney Smith, in his Principles of Phrenology,
1838, very clearly states as follows:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The existence of matter must be conceded, in an argument
which has for its object the proof that <em>there is
something besides</em>; and when that is admitted, the proof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>rests with the skeptic, who conceives that the intervention
of some other principle is necessary to account for the
phenomena presented to our experience. The hidden
qualities of this substance must be detected, and its whole
attributes known, before we can be warranted in <em>assuming
the existence of something else</em> as necessary to the production
of what is presented to our consciousness. And
when such a principle as that of galvanism or electricity,
confessedly a property of matter, can be present in or absent
from a body, attract, repel, and move, without adding
to or subtracting from the weight, heat, size, color,
or any other quality of a corpuscle, it will require some
better species of logic than any hitherto presented to establish
the impossibility of mind being a certain form,
quality, or accessory of matter, inherent in and never separated
from it. We do not argue thus because we are
confident that there exists nothing but matter; for, in
truth our feeling is that the question is involved in too
much mystery to entitle us to speak with the boldness of
settled conviction on either side. But we assume this position,
because we think the burden of proof falls on the
spiritualists, and that they have not established the necessity
of inferring the existence of another entity besides
matter to account for all the phenomena of mind,
by having failed to exhaust all the possible qualities or
probable capacities of that substance which they labor so
assiduously to degrade and despise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But while they have altogether failed to establish
this necessity, whereon depends their entire proposition,
they have recourse to the usual expedients of unsuccessful
logicians, by exciting the ignorant prejudices of bigotry
and intolerance, against all that is dignified with the
name of dispassionate philosophy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The truth is, it is time that all this fudge and cant
about the doctrine of materialism, which affects the theory
of immortality in no shape whatever--as the God who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>appointed the end could as easily ordain that the means
might be either through the medium of matter or spirit--should
be fairly put down by men of common sense and
metaphysical discrimination.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>On the same point, Mr. W. G. Moncrieff
says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Often do we hear the words, ‘Matter cannot think,’
and the trumpet of orthodoxy summons us to attend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In our simplicity we have been led to reason thus:
Matter cannot think--God made man of the dust of the
ground--then of course man cannot think! He may
grow like a palm tree, but can reason no more than it.
Now this argumentation seems really valid, and yet every
human being in his senses laughs it to scorn. <em>I do
think</em>, is the protest of each child of humanity. Then if
you do, we respond, in your case, matter must perform
the function of reflection and kindred operations. More
than living organization you are not, and if you declare
living, organized matter incapable of thought, we are
bound to infer that you have no thought at all. Accepting
your premises, we must hand you the conclusion. The
logic is good, but we are generous enough to allow that
we cannot subscribe to it. It has often occurred to us as
a fair procedure, just for the sake of bringing orthodoxy
to a stand, to assert that spirit cannot think; of course,
we are only referring to created beings, on this occasion.
We have often tried to understand the popular idea of a
spirit; and we must confess that it defies our apprehension.
It is something, nothing; a substance, an essence;
everything by turns, and nothing long. To believe that
such a production could evolve thought, is an inordinate
demand on human credulity. How the expedient was resorted
to we cannot tell: was it because thought is invisible,
that this invisible parent was sought for it? Then
why not trace heat beyond the fire, perfume beyond the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>rose, attraction beyond the sun, and vitality beyond the
branchy oak? Of all insane fancies, this popular idea of
the human spirit is the most complete; we have no wish
to give offense, but the truth must be spoken.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>We arraign this theory also before the majesty
of the brute creation. What about the immaterial
minds of the lower animals? Does matter
think in their cases? or have they also immortal
souls? Dogs, horses, monkeys, elephants, &amp;c.,
have been taught to perform different acts, imitate
various movements, and even to dance the
same tune over and over again, to accompanying
strains of music: acts which involve the exercise
of memory, will, reason, and judgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The exercise of high mental powers is shown
in the intelligence and sagacity of the horse and
elephant, in the manifold cunning of the fox, in
the beaver and bee, which construct their houses
with such mechanical ingenuity, in the mules of
the Andes, which thread with so sure a foot the
gloomy gorges and craggy <a id='corr327.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hights'>heights</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_327.22'><ins class='correction' title='hights'>heights</ins></a></span> of the mountains,
and in the dogs of St. Bernard, as they
rescue benighted and half-frozen travelers in the
passes of the Alps. Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd,
speaking of the sagacity of one of his dogs,
says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“He had never turned sheep in his life; but as soon
as he discovered that it was his duty to do so, and that it
obliged me, I can never forget with what anxiety and
eagerness he <em>learned</em> his different evolutions; he would
try every way, deliberately, till he found out what I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>wanted him to do; and when once I made him <em>understand</em>
a direction, he never mistook or forgot it. Well as I
knew him, he often astonished me, for when hard pressed,
in accomplishing the task which was set him, he had expedients
of the moment that bespoke <em>a great share of the
reasoning faculty</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>John Locke, the distinguished writer on metaphysical
questions, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Birds’ learning of tunes, and the endeavors one may
observe in them to hit the notes right, put it past doubt
with me that they have perception, and retain ideas in
their <em>memories</em>, and use them for patterns.... It
seems as evident to me that they [brutes] <em>do reason as that
they have sense</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Pritchard, On the Vital Principle, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Sensation is an attribute of the mind, and the possession
of mind certainly extends as far as its phenomena.
Whatever beings have conscious feeling, have, unless the
preceding arguments amount to nothing, souls, or immaterial
minds, distinct from the substance of which they
appear to us to be composed. <em>If all animals feel, all animals
have souls.</em>”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>H. H. Dobney, Future Punishment, p. 101,
says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“While consciousness, reason, and the sense of right
and wrong, are among the highest attributes of man,
these in a degree are allowed to be possessed by some at
least of the brute creation. Dr. Brown, according to his
biographer, Dr. Welsh, ‘believed that many of the lower
animals have the sense of right and wrong; and that the
metaphysical argument which proves the immortality of
man, extends with equal force to the other orders of
earthly existence.’”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Similar views are attributed to Coleridge and
Cudworth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dalton, in his treatise on Human Physiology,
p. 428, says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The possession of this kind of intelligence and reasoning
power, is not confined to the human species. We
have already seen that there are many instinctive actions
in man as well as in animals. It is no less true that, in
the higher animals, there is often <em>the same exercise of reasoning
power as in man</em>. The degree of this power is
much less in them than in him, <em>but its nature is the same</em>.
Whenever, in an animal, we see any action performed,
with the evident intention of accomplishing a particular
object, such an act is plainly the result of reasoning
power, not essentially different from our own.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The establishment of sentinels by gregarious animals
to warn the herd of the approach of danger; the recollection
of punishment inflicted, for a particular action,
and the subsequent avoidance or concealment of that action;
the teachability of many animals, and their capacity
of forming new habits, or improving the old ones, are
instances of the same kind of intellectual power, and <em>are
quite different from instinct</em>, strictly speaking. It is this
faculty which especially predominates over the other in
the higher classes of animals, and which finally attains its
maximum of development in the human species.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>With these testimonies from such eminent
witnesses, we leave the friends of the rational
argument inextricably mixed up with the brute
creation. The legitimate result of their theory
is to confer immortality upon all orders of animated
existence. We are sometimes accused of
degrading man to the level of the brute. But if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>our friends of the other side elevate all brutes up
to the level of man, how does that practically
differ from what they accuse us of doing? The
result is the same. If all come at last upon the
same level, it matters not whether brutes come
up or man goes down.</p>

<p class='c011'>But our view is not open to this objection.
While we deny that immortality is proved for
either man or beast by any vital or mental powers
which they may exhibit, our theory finds a
superior position for man in his more refined
mental and physical organization, whereby he
becomes possessed of a higher mental and moral
nature, and is the proper recipient of the hope of
immortality.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another fact on which it is supposed that an
argument for immortality can be founded is,</p>

<p class='c011'><em>The capacities of the soul.</em> The mind of man,
it is argued, by its wonderful achievements, and
its lofty aspirations, shows itself capable of some
higher and better state of being than we at present
enjoy. And from this the conclusion is easy
(if people will not stop to scan very critically
the connection) that such a state of being inevitably
awaits mankind, in which they are destined
to live forever.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this argument, which, stripped of its disguise,
is simply an egotistical assertion, I am fit
to be a god, and therefore I am a god, will be
found to collapse under very slight pressure. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>J. Panton Ham describes it in fitting terms, when
he speaks of it as follows:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“Because a man has skill and ability, is he therefore
immortal? We, in our ignorance and imperfection, would
exalt the intellectual above the moral. The former has
greater attractions for imperfect man than the latter.
Had we the peopling of paradise, we should fill it with the
world’s heroes in literature, science, and the arts. The
skillful are the world’s saints, and the proper candidates
for Heaven’s ‘many mansions.’ This argument, dispassionately
considered apart from the imposing parade of
human achievements, is just this: Man is <em>clever</em>, therefore
he is <em>immortal</em>. Here is neither logic nor religion.
The cleverness of man is surely no title to immortality,
much less is it the proof of its possession. It is a silly
logic which asserts human immortality from such strange
premises as balloons and pyramids, electro-telegraphs and
railways.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>But all men cannot engineer the construction
of a pyramid, nor construct a balloon, nor build
an engine, much less accomplish the greater feat
involved in their first invention. All men are
not learned and skillful, and of such eminent capabilities.
Is it not, in fact, almost an infinitely
small proportion of the human race that has
manifested those great powers on which this argument
is based! And can the capacities of a
few leading minds determine the destiny of the
great mass of men who possess no such powers?</p>

<p class='c011'>And if an argument may be based on the capacities
of some, may not an equal and opposite
argument be based on the incapacity of others?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>and in this case on which side would the weight
of evidence lie? And as there is almost every
conceivable gradation of intelligence, who will
tell us whereabouts in this scale the infinite endowment
of immortality is first perceptible?
Looking at the human race, and the races immediately
below, we behold a point where they
seem to blend indistinguishably into each other.
Will an utter lack of capacity be affirmed of the
higher orders of the brute creation? And descending
in the scale, where shall we stop?
Where is the transition from immortality to mortality?</p>

<p class='c011'>We have given, in the preceding portion of this
chapter, extracts from eminent authors showing
that brutes reason, that they exercise, to a degree,
all the powers of the human mind, that they
have a sense, to some extent, of right and wrong,
and give evidence, of the same nature as man is
able to give in reference to himself, that they
possess just as immaterial a soul as he. And
have we not all seen horses and dogs that gave
evidence of possessing more good sense than
some men? And in this graduated scale of animated
existence, where is the dividing line between
the mortal and the immortal? Will some
one locate it? What degree of mental capacity
is necessary to constitute an evidence of immortality?
And here we leave this argument. It
demands no further notice till its friends who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>base immortality on mental capacity will determine
which class of their less fortunate brothers
is so low as to be beyond its reach.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Universal belief and inborn desire.</em> Men
have universally believed in the immortality of
the soul, it is claimed, and all men desire it;
therefore, all men have it. Strange conclusion
from strange premises. As to the first part of
this argument, the universal belief, that appears
not to be true, in fact. On this, a glance at a
quotation or two must suffice. Whately (Essay
1 on a Future State) says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“We find Socrates and his disciples, represented by
Plato, as fully admitting in their discussions of the subject,
that ‘men in general were highly incredulous as to
the soul’s future existence.’ The Epicurean school openly
contended against it. Aristotle passes it by as not worth
considering, and takes for granted the contrary supposition,
as not needing proof.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Leland, on the Advantages of Revelation,
says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>When Cicero “sets himself to prove the immortality of
the soul, he represents the contrary as the prevailing opinion,”
there being “crowds of opponents, not the Epicureans
only; but, which he could not account for, those
that were the most learned persons, had that doctrine in
contempt.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Touching the other portion of the argument,
the universal and inborn desire, those who make
use of it, to make it of any avail, are bound to
supply and prove the suppressed premise, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>is that all men have what they desire. The syllogism
would then stand thus: 1. All men have
what they desire. 2. All men desire immortality.
Conclusion. Therefore, all men are immortal.
This is a fair statement of the question; but are
any presumptuous enough to take the ground
that all men have what they desire? Is it true,
in fact? Do not our every-day’s observations
give it the unqualified lie? Men desire riches,
but do all possess them? they desire health, but
do all have it? they desire happiness here, but
what an infinitely small portion of the race are
really happy. To try to get over the matter by
saying that these desires that men have <em>may</em> be
gratified by their taking a right course, is an
abandonment of the whole argument; for thus
much we readily grant concerning immortality:
all men may gratify their desires here by taking
a right course; immortality also is suspended
upon conditions, and those only will have it in
whom those conditions are found to be scrupulously
complied with.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there is another fatal flaw in this argument
in another respect; for it is not immortality
in the abstract that is the object of this great
desire among men, but <em>happiness</em>. And the very
persons who contend for immortality because
men desire it, hold that a great portion of the
race will be forever miserable. But this is not
what men desire; and not being what they desire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>it follows that all will not obtain what they
desire, and hence the argument built on desire is
good for nothing on their own showing. It simply
proves universal salvation, or that men will
be forever happy because all men desire it, or it
proves nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>The analogies of nature.</em> The day shuts down
in darkness, but is not forever lost; the morn returns
again, and the bright sun comes forth rejoicing
as a strong man to run a race. Nature is
bound, cold and lifeless, in the icy chains of winter;
but it is not lost in absolute death. Anon
the spring approaches, and at its animating voice
and warm breath, the pulse of life beats again
through all her works; her cold cheek kindles
with the glow of fresh vitality; and she comes
forth adorned with new beauty, waking new
songs of praise in every grove. The chrysalis,
too, that lay apparently a dead worm, motionless
and dry, soon wakes up to a higher life, and
comes forth gloriously arrayed, like a “living
blossom of the air,” sipping nectar from the
choicest sweets of earth, and nestling in the bosom
of its fairest flowers. And so, too, it is
claimed of man, “that when the body shall drop
as a withered calyx, the soul shall go forth like
a winged seed.”--<cite>Horticultural Address, by E.
H. Chapin.</cite></p>

<p class='c011'>Let us take care that here our judgments are
not led captive by the fascinations of poetry, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the rhetorical beauties of which this argument is
so eminently susceptible. Among the many instances
of nature, we find only a few that furnish
the analogies here presented. The chrysalis,
so often referred to, after it has spent its brief
day as a living butterfly, perishes and is heard
of no more forever. So with all the higher order
of brutes: they fall in death and make no more
their appearance upon our path. The most,
then, that can be drawn from this argument, is
a faint foreshadowing, perhaps, of a future life.
But here, let it be understood, there is no issue.
We all agree that the race shall be called again
to life. “As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall
all be made alive.” 1 Cor. 15:22. But the
point at issue is, Are our souls immortal, and
must this life be, to all our race, necessarily eternal?
To prove that man will live again is one
thing; to prove that that life will be eternal, is
quite another.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>The anomalies of the present state.</em> How often
do we here see the wicked spreading himself like
a green bay tree, having more than heart could
wish, while the righteous grope their way along,
in trouble and want. The wicked are exalted,
and the good are oppressed. This does not look
like the arrangement of a God who is the patron
of virtue and the enemy of vice. It is therefore
argued that there will be another state in which
all these wrongs shall be righted, virtue rewarded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>and wickedness punished. Yes, we reply, there
will. But, certainly, a space of time infinitely
short of eternity would suffice to correct all the
anomalies of this brief life, which so puzzle men
here. This argument, like the former, may be a
fair inference for a future state; it may portend
to the ungodly a scene of retribution, but can
prove nothing as to its duration.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Immortality assumed.</em> We are told that the
Bible assumes the immortality of the soul as a
truth so evident that it is not necessary to expressly
affirm it. This is why the doctrine has
come to be so generally received against so explicit
evidence against it. <em>It has been taken for
granted!</em> Says Bishop Tillotson:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The immortality of the soul is rather supposed, or
taken for granted, than expressly revealed in the Bible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>“It is taken for granted” that immortality is
an essential attribute of the soul, and that therefore
for the Bible to affirm it would be mere tautology.
But we reply, Is not immortality an essential
attribute also of Jehovah? Yet the Bible
has been tautological enough to plainly state this
fact. And it would seem that it might have carried
its “tautology” a little further, and told us
as much, at least <em>once</em>, about the soul, if that too
is immortal; for surely its immortality cannot be
<em>more</em> essential than that of Jehovah.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Annihilation impossible.</em> Nature everywhere
revolts, we are told, against our doctrine of annihilation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>and everywhere proves it false; for
nothing ever has been, nor ever can be, annihilated.
To which we reply, Very true; and here
we would correct the impression which some
seem to entertain, that we believe in any such
annihilation of the wicked; or the annihilation
of anything as matter. In reference to the
wicked, we simply affirm that they will be <a id='corr338.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='annilated'>annihilated</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_338.9'><ins class='correction' title='annilated'>annihilated</ins></a></span>
as living beings, the matter of which they
are composed passing into other forms. The second
definition of annihilate, according to Webster,
is, “To destroy the form or the peculiar distinctive
properties, so that the specific thing no longer
exists; as, to <em>annihilate</em> a forest by cutting and
carrying away the trees, though the timber may
still exist; to <em>annihilate</em> a house by demolishing
the structure.” Just so of the wicked: as conscious
intelligent beings they are annihilated, being
resolved into their original elements.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Evil tendency.</em> Why promulgate the doctrine
of the destruction of the wicked, it is asked, even
if it be true? Will not evil rather than good result
from it? Some, honestly no doubt, deprecate
any agitation of this question; and we have
even heard some, impelled either by their fears or
their prejudices, go so far as to declare that “it
will make more infidels than Tom Paine’s Age of
Reason,” and that “no conversions to God will
ever follow in the track of its blighting and soul-destroying
influence.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>It might be necessary first to inquire what idea
these persons have of infidelity. Perhaps they
apply that term to everything that is not in
agreement with their own views. And if this is
the standard by which they judge of this matter,
their assertion may possibly be in part correct;
for converts to this doctrine are multiplying at a
rapid rate. But giving to infidelity its legitimate
definition, we call upon all those who claim that
this doctrine makes infidels, to give some proof
of their assertion before they again repeat it.
This matter can be easily tested. The friends
and advocates of this doctrine are neither few
nor obscure. Men from all the walks of life, public
and private, are daily swelling the ranks; and
if this doctrine makes infidels, the infidels of our
day should be found among those who receive it.
But do we find them there? If one solitary individual
can be found who repudiates the Scriptures
as the revealed will of God, because he has
been made to believe that they do not teach
eternal misery for the lost, we would be glad to
see him, or even to learn of him. This is not
what causes infidelity, it is what cures it. What
do we find in the ranks of the friends of this doctrine?
Not the criminal and vicious classes, not
those who have thrown off all restraint, not rejecters
of divine revelation; but we find those
who were formerly skeptics rescued from their
skepticism, and infidels recovered from their infidelity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>We find multitudes who can now rest
down with sweet assurance on the word of God,
the perplexities with which they had been troubled
respecting God’s dealings with his creatures
all cleared from the mind, and whose feelings
may be well expressed in the following language
from Henry Constable, A. M.:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“For myself, I cannot express my sense of the value I
place on the view I now seek to impress on others. It
has for me thrown a light on God’s character, and God’s
word, and the future of his world, which I once thought
I should never have seen on this side of the grave. It
has not removed the wholesome and necessary terrors of
the Lord from the mind, but it has clothed God with a
loveliness which makes him, and the eternal Son who represents
him to man, incalculably more attractive. I am
no longer looking for shifts to excuse his conduct in my
own eyes and those of others, and forced to feel that here
at least I could never find one to answer my object. I
can look at all he has done, and all he tells me he will
hereafter do, and, scanning it closely, and examining it
even where it has most of awe and severity, exclaim with
all my heart and with all my understanding--‘Just and
true are thy ways, thou King of saints.’”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>These are among its general good effects. But
there exists a special reason at the present time
why men should be made acquainted with the
true teachings of the Bible on this question. It
is the only antidote against modern spiritualism,
that master-piece of Satanic cunning and deception,
and the climax of his corrupting work in
the earth. In what horrid blasphemies has this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>delusion arrayed itself! To what corruption
does it lead its votaries! How utterly it debauches
the moral natures of all those who suffer
themselves to receive its polluting touch! And
notwithstanding it carries in its train all these
terrible evils, how rapidly is it spreading through
the land, and at what a fearful rate is it swelling
the catalogue of its victims!</p>

<p class='c011'>Why is this? It is because the way has long
and thoroughly been prepared for it in the doctrine
of the conscious state of the dead, and the
immortality of the soul. This is its foundation,
its life and spirit. Take away this, and it is robbed
of its vitality. For if it be true, as the Bible
declares, that when a man goes into the grave,
his thoughts perish, his love and hatred and envy
are no longer exercised, and he knows not anything,
then whatever spirit comes to us from the
unseen world, professing to be the spirit of a dead
man, it comes with a lie in its mouth, and thus
shows itself to be of the synagogue of Satan. This
is the Ithuriel spear that transforms this lying
system, which at its best showing is as low and
ugly as the blotchiest toad that ever lived, into
the real devil that it is. Then let this truth be
spread abroad on all the wings of the wind, that
in the hands of the people may be placed some
safeguard against this ghastly embodiment of
falsehood, pollution, and death.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the truth clearly stated as to how God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>will deal with the sinner and finally dispose of
sin, we can appeal with confidence to the calm
reason and the better nature of every child of
Adam. We can second the tender entreaty which
God extends to every wayward soul, “Turn ye,
turn ye, for why will ye die?” “As I live, saith
the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of
the wicked, but that he turn from his way and
live.” Life and death are set before you. The
Saviour bids you look unto him and live. Mercy
entreats you to destroy not yourself. The spirit
and the bride bid you come and partake of the
water of life freely.</p>

<p class='c011'>You can no longer take refuge from an awakened
conscience under the idea that the threatenings
of the Lord are not understood, and may not
therefore be so terrific as supposed. The sinner’s
doom is unmistakably declared; and in the justness
of that sentence, however slightly you may
now realize the heinousness and just desert of
sin, your own reason can but heartily concur.
Will you then plunge headlong to ruin? or will
you turn and accept the immense gratuity of
eternal life? Of course you do not <em>mean</em> to perish.
We accuse you not of this. The shining
form of Hope is dancing on before you in the path
of life--hope that ere it is too late, ere the silver
cord be loosed or ever the golden bowl be broken,
you will make sure a treasure and inheritance in
Heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>We would impress upon your mind that this
hope <em>may</em> deceive you. Ere you reach the delusive
phantom, the earth may suddenly open beneath
your feet, and Hades receive you to its
fixed embrace. Ere you overtake the beckoning
form, ere the good intention be carried out, ere
you grasp the prize now held only by the uncertain
tenure of good resolve, the glory of the coming
Judge, descending through the parting and
dissolving heavens, may suddenly burst upon
your unprepared soul. Yes! the great voice
from the temple of Heaven, crying, “It is finished!”
may suddenly arrest you in the midst of
your delaying and dallying career! The heavenly
court of mercy may cease its sitting, ere you
have made a friend of the great Advocate who
alone can plead your cause!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Procrastination is the thief of time.” It may
be the thief of your eternal bliss. Its every moment
is high-handed and insane presumption. Its
path is a path of unseen and innumerable dangers.
You have no lease of your life. The present state
is one of exposure and peril. The shafts of death
are flying thickly about you. Time is short and
its sands are swiftly falling. The bliss of Heaven,
or the blackness of darkness forever, will soon be
yours. With the saved or lost you must soon
take your position. There is no intermediate
ground. Choose, then, we beseech you, the enduring
portion. Choose for eternity, choose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>wisely, choose <em>now</em>. And may it be ours to join
the great song of salvation at last, ascribing blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power, unto Him
who sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb
who poured out his soul an offering for sin, that
whosoever would believe on him might not perish
but have everlasting life.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>APPENDIX. <br /> <span class='fss'>MORALITY OF THE DOCTRINE OF A FUTURE LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The following is from “The Doctrine of a Future
Life,” by W. R. Alger. He here discusses
the “morality of the doctrine of a future life” on
the strong hypothesis that there is to be no existence
hereafter, and utterly disproves the conclusions
which some would make the inevitable consequence
of such a doctrine. The same objections
are urged against the view we entertain that
after the Judgment the sinner is to endure a punishment
which reaches its climax in the loss of
existence. With a hundred-fold more force the
reasoning of Mr. Alger lies against these objections
when urged in opposition to our view. We
have in this life the great incentive to goodness
and virtue, that is involved in the hope of immortality,
seconded by the wonderful intervention
of Christ in our behalf, which is calculated
to arouse all the nobler sentiments of our being.
If this will not win men from sin to a holy life,
they would not be driven to it by threats of eternal
torture. Mr. Alger says:--</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c011'>“The morality of the doctrine of a future life having
thus been defended from the attacks of those who have
sought to destroy it in the fancied interests either of the
enjoyments of the earth, or of the purity of virtue and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>religion, it now remains to free it from the still more fatal
supports which false or superficial religionists have
sought to give it by wrenching out of it meanings it never
held, by various perverse abuses of it, by monstrous exaggerations
of its moral importance to the present. We
have seen that the supposition of another life, correctly
interpreted, lays no new duty upon man, takes away from
him no old duty or privilege, but simply gives to the previously-existing
facts of the case the intensifying glory
and strength of fresh light, motive, and consolation. But
many public teachers, not content to treat the subject
with this sobriety of reason, instead of presenting the
careful conclusions of a conscientious analysis, have sought
to strengthen their argument to the feelings by help of
prodigious assumptions, assumptions hastily adopted,
highly colored, and authoritatively urged. Upon the hypothesis
that annihilation is the fate of man, they are not
satisfied merely to take away from the present all the additional
light, incentive, and comfort, imparted by the
faith in a future existence, but they arbitrarily remove
all the alleviations and glories intrinsically belonging to
the scene, and paint it in the most horrible hues, and set
it in a frame of midnight. Thus, instead of calmly seeking
to elicit and recommend truth, they strive, by terrifying
the fancy and shocking the prejudices, to make people
accept their dogma because frightened at the seeming
consequences of rejecting it. It is necessary to expose
the fearful fallacies which have been employed in this
way, and which are yet extensively used for the same
purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even a Christian writer usually so judicious as Andrews
Norton has said: ‘Without the belief in personal
immortality there can be no religion; for what can any
truths of religion concern the feelings and the conduct of
beings whose existence is limited to a few years in this
world?’ Such a statement from such a quarter is astonishing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Surely the sentiments natural to a person or incumbent
upon him do not depend on the <em>duration</em> of his
being, but on the character, endowments, and relations
of his being. The hypothetical fact that man perishes
with his body does not destroy God, does not destroy
man’s dependence on God for all his privileges, does not
annihilate the overwhelming magnificence of the universe,
does not alter the native sovereignty of holiness,
does not quench our living reason, imagination, or sensibility,
while they last. The soul’s gratitude, wonder,
love, and worship, are just as right and instinctive as before.
If our experience on earth, before the phenomena
of the visible creation and in conscious communion with
the emblemed attributes of God, does not cause us to
kneel in humility and to adore in awe, then it may be
doubted if Heaven or hell will ever persuade us to any
sincerity in such acts. The simple prolongation of our
being does not add to its qualitative contents, cannot increase
the kinds of our capacity or the number of our duties.
Chalmers utters an injurious error in saying as he
does, ‘If there be no future life, the moral constitution
of man is stripped of its significancy, and the Author of
that constitution is stripped of his wisdom, and authority
and honor.’ The creative Sovereign of fifty million
firmaments of worlds, ‘stripped of his wisdom and authority
and honor,’ because a few insects on a little speck
are not eternal! Can egotistic folly any further go?
The affirmation or denial of immortality neither adds to
nor diminishes the numerical relations and ingredients of
our nature and experience. If religion is fitted for us on
the former supposition, it is also on the latter. To any
dependent intelligence blessed with our human susceptibilities,
reverential love and submission are as obligatory,
natural and becoming on the brink of annihilation as on
the verge of immortality. Rebellious egotism makes all
the difference. Truth is truth, whatever it be. Religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>is the meek submission of self-will to God’s will. That
is a duty not to be escaped, no matter what the future reserves
or excludes for us.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Another sophism almost universally accepted needs to
be shown. Man, it is said, has no interest in a future
life if not conscious in it of the past. If, on exchange of
worlds, man loses his memory, he virtually ceases to exist,
and might just as well be annihilated. A future life
with perfect oblivion of the present is no life at all for us.
Is not this style of thought the most provincial egotism,
the utter absence of all generous thought and sympathy unselfishly
grasping the absolute boons of being? It is a shallow
error, too, even on the grounds of selfishness itself. In
any point of view the difference is diametric and immense
between a happy being in an eternal present, unconscious
of the past, and no being at all. Suppose a man thirty
years of age were offered his choice to die this moment,
or to live fifty years longer of unalloyed success and happiness,
only with a complete forgetfulness of all that has
happened up to this moment. He would not hesitate to
grasp the gift, however much he regretted the condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It has often been argued that with the denial of a retributive
life beyond the grave all restraints are taken off
from the passions, free course given to every impulse.
Chateaubriand says bluntly, ‘There can be no morality if
there be no future state.’ With displeasing coarseness,
and with most reprehensible recklessness of reasoning,
Luther says, in contradiction to the essential nobleness
of his loving, heroic nature, ‘If you believe in no future
life, I would not give a mushroom for your God. Do,
then, as you like. For if no God, so no devil, no hell:
as with a fallen tree, all is over when you die. Then
plunge into lechery, rascality, robbery, and murder.’
What bible of Moloch had he been studying to form, for
the time, so horrid a theory of the happiest life, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>put so degrading an estimate upon human nature? Is
man’s will a starved wolf, only held back by the triple
chain of fear of death, Satan, and hell, from tearing
forth with ravenous bounds to flesh the fangs of his desires
in bleeding virtue and innocence? Does the greatest
satisfaction man is capable of here, the highest blessedness
he can attain to, consist in drunkenness, gluttony,
dishonesty, violence, and impiety? If he had the
appetite of a tiger or a vulture,--then, thus to wallow in
the offal of vice, dive into the carrion of sensuality, abandon
himself to reveling in <a id='corr349.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='carniverous'>carnivorous</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_349.11'><ins class='correction' title='carniverous'>carnivorous</ins></a></span> crime, might be
his instinct and his happiness. But by virtue of his humanity
man loves his fellows, enjoys the scenery of nature,
takes delight in thought and art, dilates with grand
presentiments of glory and eternity, mysteriously yearns
after the hidden God. To a reasonable man--and no
other is to be reasoned with on matters of truth and interest--the
assumption of this brief season as all, will be
a double motive not to hasten and imbitter its brevity by
folly, excess, and sin. If you are to be dead to-morrow,
for that very reason, in God’s name, do not, by gormandizing
and guzzling, anticipate death to-day! The true
restraint from wrong and degradation is not a crouching
conscience of superstition and selfishness, fancying a
chasm of fire, but a high-toned conscience of reason and
honor, perceiving that they <em>are</em> wrong and degradation,
and spontaneously loathing them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Still worse, many esteemed authors have not hesitated
to assert that unless there be a future life there is not
only no check on passion within, but no moral law without:
every man is free to do what he pleases, without
blame or fault. Sir Kenelm Digby says, in his ‘Treatise
on Man’s Soule,’ that ‘to predicate mortality in the
soule taketh away all morality, and changeth men into
beastes, by removing the ground of all difference in those
thinges which are to governe our actions.’ This style of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>teaching is a very mischievous absurdity. Admit, for a
moment, that Jocko in the woods of Brazil, and Schiller
in the brilliant circles of Weimar, will at last meet the
same fate in the dusty grasp of death; yet, while they
live, one is an ape, the other is a man. And the differences
of capacity and of duty are numberless and immense.
The statement is enough: argument would be
ridiculous. The words of an audacious French preacher
are yet more shocking than those of the English nobleman.
It is hard to believe they could be uttered in good
faith. Says Massillon, in his famous declamation on immortality,
‘If we wholly perish with the body, the maxims
of charity, patience, justice, honor, gratitude, and
friendship, are but empty words. Our own passions
shall decide our duty. If retribution terminate with the
grave, morality is a mere chimera, a bugbear of human
invention.’ What debauched unbeliever ever inculcated
a viler or a more fatal doctrine? Its utter baselessness,
as a single illustration may show, is obvious at a glance.
As the sciences of algebra and geometry, the relations of
numbers and bodies, are true for the material world although
they may be lost sight of when time and space are
transcended in some higher state, so the science of ethics,
the relations of nobler and baser, of right and wrong, the
manifold grades and qualities of actions and motives, are
true for human nature and experience in this life even if
men perish in the grave. However soon certain facts are
to end, while they endure they are as they are. In a
moment of carelessness, by some strange slip of the
mind,--showing, perhaps, how tenaciously rooted are the
common prejudice and falsehood on this subject,--even
so bold and fresh a thinker as Theodore Parker has contradicted
his own philosophy by declaring, ‘If to-morrow
I perish utterly, then my fathers will be to me only as the
ground out of which my bread-corn is grown. I shall
care nothing for the generations of mankind. I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>know no higher law than passion. Morality will vanish.’
Ah, man reveres his fathers, and loves to act nobly, not
because he is to live forever, but because he is a man.
And, though all the summer hopes of escaping the grave
were taken from human life, choicest and tenderest virtues
might still flourish, as it is said the German cross-bill
pairs and broods in the dead of winter. The martyr’s
sacrifice and the voluptuary’s indulgence are very different
things to-day, if they do both cease to-morrow. No
speed of advancing destruction can equalize Agamemnon
and Thersites, Mansfield and Jeffries, or hustle together
justice and fraud, cowardice and valor, purity and corruption,
so that they will interchange qualities. There
is an eternal and immutable morality, as whiteness is
white, and blackness is black, and triangularity is triangular.
And no severance of temporal ties or compression
of spatial limits can ever cut the condign bonds of duty
and annihilate the essential distinctions of good and evil,
magnanimity and meanness, faithfulness and treachery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Reducing our destiny from endless to definite cannot
alter the inherent rightfulness and superiority of the
claims of virtue. The most it can do is to lessen the
strength of the motive, to give the great motor-nerve of
our moral life a perceptible stroke of palsy. In reference
to the question, Can ephemera have a moral law? Richter
reasons as follows: ‘Suppose a statue besouled for
two days. If on the first day you should shatter it, and
thus rob it of one day’s life, would you be guilty of murder?
One can injure only an immortal.’ The sophistry
appears when we rectify the conclusion thus: one can inflict
an <em>immortal</em> injury only on an immortal being. In
fact, it would appear to be a greater wrong and injury,
for the time, to destroy one day’s life of a man whose entire
existence was confined to two days, than it would be
to take away the same period from the bodily existence
of one who immediately thereupon passes into a more exalted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>and eternal life. To the sufferer, the former would
seem an immitigable calamity, the latter a benign furtherance;
while, in the agent, the overt act is the same.
This general moral problem has been more accurately answered
by Isaac Taylor, whose lucid statement is as follows:
‘The creatures of a summer’s day might be imagined,
when they stand upon the threshold of their term
of existence, to make inquiry concerning the attributes of
the Creator and the rules of his government; for these
are to be the law of their season of life and the measure
of their enjoyments. The sons of immortality would put
the same questions with an intensity the greater from the
greater stake.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Practically, the acknowledged authority of the moral
law in human society cannot be destroyed. Its influence
may be unlimitedly weakened, its basis variously altered,
but as a confessed sovereign principle it cannot be
expelled. The denial of the freedom of the will theoretically
explodes it; but social custom, law, and opinion
will enforce it still. Make man a mere dissoluble mixture
of carbon and magnetism, yet so long as he can distinguish
right and wrong, good and evil, love and hate, and,
unsophisticated by dialectics, can follow either of opposite
courses of action, the moral law exists and exerts its
sway. It has been asked, ‘If the incendiary be, like the
fire he kindles, a result of material combinations, shall he
not be treated in the same way?’ We should reply thus:
No matter what man springs from or consists of, if he
has moral ideas, performs moral actions, and is susceptible
of moral motives, then he is morally responsible; for
all practical and disciplinary purposes he is wholly removed
from the categories of physical science.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Another pernicious misrepresentation of the fair consequences
of the denial of a life hereafter is shown in the
frequent declaration that then there would be no motive
to any thing good and great. The incentives which animate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>men to strenuous services, perilous virtues, disinterested
enterprises, spiritual culture, would cease to operate.
The essential life of all moral motives would be
killed. This view is to be met by a broad and indignant
denial based on an appeal to human consciousness and to
the reason of the thing. Every man knows by experience
that there are a multitude of powerful motives, entirely
disconnected with future reward or punishment,
causing him to resist evil and to do good even with self-sacrificing
toil and danger. When the fireman risks his
life to save a child from the flames of a tumbling house,
is the hope of Heaven his motive? When the soldier
spurns an offered bribe and will not betray his comrades
nor desert his post, is the fear of hell all that animates
him? A million such decisive specifications might be
made. The renowned sentence of Cicero, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Nemo unquam
sine magna spe immortalitatis se pro patria offerret
ad mortem</em></span>,” is effective eloquence; but it is a baseless libel
against humanity and the truth. In every moment
of supreme nobleness and sacrifice, personality vanishes.
Thousands of patriots, philosophers, saints, have been
glad to die for the freedom of native land, the cause of
truth, the welfare of fellow-men, without a taint of selfish
reward touching their wills. Are there not souls</p>

<p class='c020'>He must be the basest of men who would decline to do
any sublime act of virtue because he did not expect to
enjoy the consequences of it eternally. Is there no motive
for the preservation of health because it cannot be
an everlasting possession? Since we cannot eat sweet
and wholesome food forever, shall we therefore at once
saturate our stomachs with nauseating poisons?</p>

<p class='c011'>“If all experienced good and evil wholly terminate for
us when we die, still, every intrinsic reason which, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>supposition of immortality, makes wisdom better than
folly, industry better than sloth, righteousness better
than iniquity, benevolence and purity better than hatred
and corruption, also makes them equally preferable while
they last. Even if the philosopher and the idiot, the religious
philanthropist and the brutal pirate, did die alike,
who would not rather live like the sage and the saint than
like the fool and the felon? Shall Heaven be held before
man simply as a piece of meat before a hungry dog
to make him jump well? It is a shocking perversion of
the grandest doctrine of faith. Let the theory of annihilation
assume its direst phase, still, our perception of
principles, our consciousness of sentiments, our sense of
moral loyalty, are not dissolved, but will hold us firmly
to every noble duty until we ourselves flow into the dissolving
abyss. But some one may say, ‘If I have fought
with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me if the
dead rise not?’ It advantageth you everything <em>until you
are dead</em>, although there be nothing afterwards. As long
as you live is it not glory and reward enough <em>to have conquered</em>
the beasts at Ephesus? This is sufficient reply to
the unbelieving flouters at the moral law. And, as an unanswerable
refutation of the feeble whine of sentimentality
that without immortal endurance nothing is worthy
our affection, let great Shakespeare advance, with his
matchless depth of bold insight reversing the conclusion,
and pronouncing, in tones of cordial solidity,--</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘This, thou perceivest, will make thy love more strong,</div>

<p class='c020'>“What though Decay’s shapeless hand extinguish us?
Its foreflung and enervating shadow shall neither transform
us into devils nor degrade us into beasts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The future life, outside of the realm of faith, to an
earnest and independent inquirer, and considered as a
scientific question, lies in a painted mist of uncertainty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>There is room for hope, and there is room for doubt.
The wavering evidences in some moods preponderate on
that side, in other moods, on this side. Meanwhile it is
clear that, while he lives here, the best thing he can do is
to cherish a devout spirit, cultivate a noble character,
lead a pure and useful life in the service of wisdom, humanity,
and God, and finally, when the appointed time
arrives, meet the issue with reverential and affectionate
conformity, without dictating terms. Let the vanishing
man say, like Ruckert’s dying flower, ‘Thanks to-day for
all the favors I have received from sun and stream and
earth and sky,--for all the gifts from men and God which
have made my little life an ornament and a bliss. Heaven,
stretch out thine azure tent while my faded one is sinking
here. Joyous spring-tide, roll on through ages yet
to come, in which fresh generations shall rise and be glad.
Farewell all! Content to have had my turn, I now fall
asleep, without a murmur or a sigh.’ Surely the mournful
nobility of such a strain of sentiment is preferable by
much to the selfish terror of that unquestioning belief
which in the Middle Age depicted the chase of the soul
by Satan, on the columns and doors of the churches, under
the symbol of a deer pursued by a hunter and hounds;
and which has in later times produced in thousands the
feeling thus terribly expressed by Bunyan, ‘I blessed the
condition of the dog and toad because they had no soul
to perish under the everlasting weight of hell!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sight of truth, with devout and loving submission to
it, is an achievement whose nobleness outweighs its sorrow,
even if the gazer foresee his own destruction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not our intention in these words to cast doubt
on the immortality of the soul, or to depreciate the value
of a belief in it. We desire to vindicate morality and religion
from the unwitting attacks made on them by many
self-styled Christian writers in their exaggeration of the
practical importance of such a faith. The qualitative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>contents of human nature have nothing to do with its
quantitative contents: our duties rest not on the length,
but on the faculties and relations, of our existence. Make
the life of a dog endless, he has only the capacity of a
dog; make the life of a man finite, still, within its limits,
he has the psychological functions of humanity. Faith in
immortality may enlarge and intensify the motives to prudent
and noble conduct; it does not create new ones.
The denial of immortality may pale and contract those
motives; it does not take them away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Knowing the burden and sorrow of earth, brooding
in dim solicitude over the far times and men yet to be,
we cannot recklessly utter a word calculated to lessen the
hopes of man, pathetic creature, who weeps into the
world and faints out of it. It is our faith--not knowledge--that
the spirit is without terminus or rest. The
faithful truth-hunter, in dying, finds not a covert, but a
better trail. Yet the saintliness of the intellect is to be
purged from prejudice and self-will. With God we are
not to prescribe conditions. The thought that all high
virtue and piety must die with the abandonment of belief
in immortality is as pernicious and dangerous as it is
shallow, vulgar, and unchristian. The view is obviously
gaining prevalence among scientific and philosophical
thinkers, that life is the specialization of the universal in
the individual, death the restoration of the individual to
the whole. This doubt as to a personal future life will
unquestionably increase. Let traditional teachers beware
how they venture to shift the moral law from its immutable
basis in the will of God to a precarious poise on the
selfish hope and fear of man. The sole safety, the ultimate
desideratum, is perception of law with disinterested
conformity.”--<cite>Doctrine of a Future Life</cite>, pp. 652-661.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
